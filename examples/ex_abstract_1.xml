    <title>A Computational Approach to Edge Detection</title>
    <author>John Canny</author>

        <setting type="s1">This paper describes a computational approach to edge
            detection.</setting>
        <gap type="g2">The success of the approach depends on the definition of a comprehensive set
            of goals for the computation of edge points. These goals must be precise enough to
            delimit the desired behavior of the detector while making minimal assumptions about the
            form of the solution.</gap>
        <methodology type="m1">We define detection and localization criteria for a class of edges,
            and present mathematical forms for these criteria as functionals on the operator impulse
            response. A third criterion is then added to ensure that the detector has only one
            response to a single edge. We use the criteria in numerical optimization to derive
            detectors for several common image features, including step edges.</methodology>
        <results type="r2">On specializing the analysis to step edges, we find that there is a
            natural uncertainty principle between detection and localization performance, which are
            the two main goals.</results>
        <purpose type="p3">With this principle we derive a single operator shape which is optimal at
            any scale. The optimal detector has a simple approximate implementation in which edges
            are marked at maxima in gradient magnitude of a Gaussian-smoothed image. We extend this
            simple detector using operators of several widths to cope with different signal-to-noise
            ratios in the image.</purpose>
        <conclusion type="c1"> We present a general method, called feature synthesis, for the
            fine-to-coarse integration of information from operators at different scales. Finally we
            show that step edge detector performance improves considerably as the operator point
            spread function is extended along the edge.</conclusion>
