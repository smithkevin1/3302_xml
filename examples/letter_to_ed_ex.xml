        Fireworks are a blast
        
        It’s time for Massachusetts to join the rest of the country and legalize the use of consumer fireworks (“N.Y. man arrested with fireworks in Massachusetts,” June 25). This will be the second year New York is permitting the sale and use of some consumer fireworks, and the results have been very successful.
        
        Since 1994, there has been a dramatic increase in the rate of fireworks used in the U.S. During the same time period, the rate of fireworks-related injures has gone down.
        
        Massachusetts should join the 47 states that permit some level of consumer fireworks.
