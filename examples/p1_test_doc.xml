                and Young Men to test their hypothesis that nonfamily living by young adults alters
                their attitudes, values, plans, and expectations, moving them away from their belief
                in traditional sex roles.</summary>
            <summary type="general">They find their hypothesis strongly supported in young females,
                while the effects were fewer in studies of young males. Increasing the time away
                from parents before marrying increased individualism, self-sufficiency, and changes
                in attitudes about families.</summary>
            <relevance type="value_stmt">In contrast, an earlier study by Williams cited below shows
                no significant gender differences in sex role attitudes as a result of nonfamily
                living.</relevance>
            <relevance type="application">This debate in the sociological literature is important
                for anyone seeking to historicize the “family values” debate of the 1980s and 90s in
                the U.S.</relevance>

            <summary type="interpretation">It's clearly anti-genetic engineering; its chapter titles
                give a good idea of the direction and flavor of the book, for example, "Eugenics,"
                "Eliminating 'Bad' Genes," "Bio-Futures," "Scientists and Corporation." Though the
                book is dated, the debates surrounding gene therapy at the time of the book’s
                publication are remarkably similar to today.</summary>
