            <question>The question or topic that we are trying to answer or simplify to a general 
                audience.</question>
            <pb/>
            <scientific_principle n="1">Big picture fundamental scientific concepts involved (such as
                gravity, matter and energy, fluid dynamics, acid-base reactions,
                etc.) <important_idea n="1">Major points of interest relating to the topic.</important_idea></scientific_principle>
            <pb/>
            <misconceptions n="1">Lists any common misconceptions the public has about the topic, or
                includes quoted material from the community that highlights the existing (false)
                notions about the answer. <ref type="source" url="http://su16awd.kevingeraldsmith.com">This is a link to a source<!-- Types can be "source" or "supplement" for

        <answer>Body of text that moves towards the answer of the question, presenting topics,
            ideas, analogies, and explanations that lead towards the ultimate conclusion
            <fundamental_science_involved n="">A wide-angled cursory description of the basic ideas
                framing the answer.  <analogy>Analogies should be used to better illustrate important and difficult to understand
                    topics put forth by the other elements.</analogy> Can be as little as 1 sentence. Ex. Explain one of Newton’s
                Laws, or introduce the basic idea of chemical reactions, etc. </fundamental_science_involved>
            <question_relevant_topic n="">Specific scientific principles that are directly relevant to
                the explanation of the question. Ex. A description of the chemistry behind acid-base
                reactions. </question_relevant_topic>
            <explanation n="">An in-depth reply to the question proposed in the “background”
                section.<pb/> Typically, the author will use common vernacular and devices such as
                analogies and visuals in order to clearly convey concepts to readers.</explanation><pb/>
            <conclusion>A conclusion that sums up what was just explained. It acts as a concise
                response to the question asked in the “background” section </conclusion>
