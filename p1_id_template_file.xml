            <summary><approach>use data from the National Longitudinal Surveys of Young Women and
                    Young Men to test their hypothesis that nonfamily living by young adults alters
                    their attitudes, values, plans, and expectations, moving them away from their
                    belief in traditional sex roles.</approach> They find their hypothesis strongly
                supported in young females, while the effects were fewer in studies of young males.
                Increasing the time away from parents before marrying increased individualism,
                self-sufficiency, and changes in attitudes about families.</summary>
            <relevance><value_stmt>In contrast, an earlier study by Williams cited below shows no
                    significant gender differences in sex role attitudes as a result of nonfamily
                    living.</value_stmt>
                <application>This debate in the sociological literature is important for anyone
                    seeking to historicize the “family values” debate of the 1980s and 90s in the
                    U.S.</application></relevance>
