        <problem_stmt> The web app Northeastern uses to help students search for co-ops is
            antiquated. The tools used to navigate the site are lackluster and the whole service suffers
            from poor contributer (co-op providers) input. It is important to focus on the issue being one of
            usability and interface quality rather then this being a back end problem. This meaning the issue is primarily 
            related to the aspects of the web service that the user can see and interact with (or not in the case of a lack of features).

            <background type="source">Rinder's capstone report brings together a large collection
                of professional works regarding the history of website usability and the actual 
                process of testing it. The author brings this to us in the form of a scholarly annotated bibliography
                This University of Oregon report also provides us with a large scope
                of website usability, including recent influences on web usability all the way through how these can be 
                discovered.

            <summary type="approach">The Importance of Website Usability starts off with a strong idea: that
                perceived usability is key to user satisfaction. Rinder often takes a business focused lens
                when discussing usability and why it is important, the ideas are relevant to all circles. The report outlines
                the criteria it used for sources, including looking for authority and quality. After the bulk of the report consisting of
                annotated bibliographies, Rinder has a lengthy conclusion, breaking down what the author considers to be the defining 
                principles of usability, comparing and contrasting other authors ideas and often noting the similarities. The majority of his analytical 
                work comes in the conclusion, and it focuses heavily on the importance and process of reliable testing.

            </summary>
            <relevance type="value_stmt"> Rinder presents this simple idea: Users use and return to websites if they can easily find useful information-in other words,
                the acceptability of web applications relies on their usability. This is well said. Unfortunately in some
                cases, users don't have the choice. If you are looking for compelling reading into why you should appreciate well made
                web services, look no further. Although Rinder focuses heavily on usability testing rather then the philosophy behind usability, readers may
                find the conclusion detailing usability more relevant for creating arguments for and how to improve services.

                interest of developing new ones.

            <summary type="general"> The article takes an analytical approach to different paradigms explaining
                the common low usability of web services. The two authors look at a number of publications that 
                analyze similar topics and add to previous work in the field. Similar to other medium analysis work, the two
                authors develop their own principles of web design and go into an in-depth explanation of each. The authors also
                provide evidence for a number of original thesis relevant to the development of faculty and staff web portals

                web portals for faculty and students. If this is what you are researching, this is paper is loaded with relevant original data and analysis.
                That should not discourage other researchers. The two authors make a number of important queries into the effects of images and layouts to navigability,
                which could be applied to any web service. The data the two authors collected is gathered mostly from tech savy masters students, which presents a clear bias. 
                Although that may be unavoidable at such a technical college. Despite this the research is valuable and the authors make a number
                of interesting arguments throughout the piece that anyone interested in digital interfaces would benefit from reading.

            <background type="source"> The introduction to this article discusses a very common
                theme among web design research; websites play a central role in modern
                marketing. Specifically that one time, it was enough to just own a website, but now that website
                are forced to compete vigorously. This paradigm influences the majority of the piece, and 
                and provides the reader with a valuable bare bones history.
