        <problem_stmt>In neural engineering, there currently exist many gaps between current
            technology available to the public, and where public necessity lies. Demand comes
            primarily from the clinical sector, wherein individuals suffering from neurodegenerative
            diseases are left at a deficit in their ability to sense and interact with the world
            around them. Challenges facing the technology mainly center around decoding the
            biochemical signals within the central nervous system, encoding information technology
            into biochemical signals, and creating devices that are able to function within or in
            tandem with biological systems. Neural engineering as a discipline attempts to close
            these gaps by taking neurobiological, materials science, biotechnological, and computer
            science research and designing devices and techniques to integrate technology with
            neurobiology. Much of the work takes place in pre-clinical and clinical research
            contexts, and the applied aspect of the discipline is still by-and-large in its infancy,
            as technology begins to catch up to what is demanded by the applications. Ultimately,
            the goal of the discipline is to create devices that work seamlessly with biological
            systems, are non-invasive or biologically integrated, and allow complete restoration of
            function without loss of fidelity.<note type="instructor">So, as I understand it, your
                'problem' is the gap between current neural engineering tech available to the public
                and the demand for said tech? Or is it more broadly the further development of this
                (relatively) nascent field of research? The question is whether your problem is
                about development or implementation, I guess.</note>

                respect to how you outline the approach (very important with a field as complex as
                this). I was (as you can see by my note) just a bit lost reading your problem
                statement; perhaps a revision would include just a sentence or so that specifically
                circumscribes the issue you are taking on in the annotated bib. After reading your
