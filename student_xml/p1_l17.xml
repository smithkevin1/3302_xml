        <problem_stmt> In the US, every ten years states redraw the boundaries of voting districts
            to conform with the most recent census data. Gerrymandering is the intentional and
            strategic drawing of voting district boundaries to diminish your political rivals'
            influence. This can be done by either "packing" a district by relegating a large group
            of demographically similar people into only a few districts where they make up a
            majority, or by "cracking" a group by dispersing them between many districts so they
            never constitute a large enough portion of a constituency to win. This practice
            deliberately undermines our intended system of representative government. However, with
            the advent of the computer and the compilation of detailed demographic information into
            digital databases such as GIS (geographic information system) the use of what are
            conventionally engineering methods has been suggested as a way to mitigate this. Through
            the marriage of data optimization with the political process steps can be taken toward
            depoliticizing a task that should simply be an unbiased and mundane piece of
            housekeeping to keep our democracy functioning properly. </problem_stmt>
