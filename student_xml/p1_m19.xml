        <problem_stmt> Electrical engineering is a broad field that can cover anything from
            artificial intelligence, to cutting edge healthcare solutions, to personal electronics.
            There are countless other applications in this discipline, but the end goal is the same
            â€“ to improve the overall quality of life. One way that engineers are trying to achieve
            this goal is by designing and implementing solutions to help improve the production and
            distribution of fresh food. While the lack of access to food is a global problem, it can
            especially affect urban areas. And as time goes on, the population will only to continue
            to grow and increase the severity of this problem. While the quantity of available food
            is certainly important, the quality should be considered too; to feed a hungry
            community, bringing in more fast food chains is not a healthy solution. This is where
            electrical engineers can help. By using skills from their discipline, they can create
            innovative technology to grow and deliver fresh produce year round. This technology
            already exists here in Boston and Cambridge, and it is led by startups that have visions
            for a healthier future. </problem_stmt>
