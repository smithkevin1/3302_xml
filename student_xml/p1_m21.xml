        <problem_stmt> My discipline of mechanical engineering typically deals with problems of
            efficiency and in turn sustainability. It addresses current systems in place and works
            to improve their output while reducing their energy consumption. In the case of Bostonâ€™s
            public transportation and sanitation, it is important to address the problem of high
            amounts of fossil fuels being burned to keep the city functioning. A change in this area
            will not only help combat global warming as a whole, it will lead to reductions in both
            air and noise pollution in the city. It will affect both the general public who use
            public transportation as well as many residents who live at or near street level in the
            city. My discipline offers insights into the differences between internal combustion
            engines and electric motors. It can compare the cost/benefits of each in terms of
            accessibility, reliability, feasibility, and price. The input it provides can then be
            used to move forward in making a decision on how to best improve or alter the current
            fleet of vehicles that the city uses. </problem_stmt>
