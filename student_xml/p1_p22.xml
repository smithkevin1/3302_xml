                This update to a study conducted in 2012 on the relationship between air pollutants and various diseases shows that the current situation is worse than previously thought. In particular, this study outlines how the most voulnerable groups to air pollution, children and the elderly, are the most exposed to it due to their more stagnant lifestyle.

            <summary type="interpretation">  
                While the statistics in this study generally speak for themselves, it is worth pointing out that the sources of the pollutants do not effect all people equally. For this reason, it is important to understand the actual externality dispersion so that our portions of the burden are put into perspective.

However, first and foremost, it is to be used to set the groundwork for any arguement regarding public health as it related to air pollution.
