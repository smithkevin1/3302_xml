        <problem_stmt> World War II saw Americans willfully ration clothes and gasoline, plant war
            gardens, and participate in scrap metal drives to manufacture bullets. The effort on the
            home front came as an overlooked victory, proving that the nation could survive — thrive
            even — without superfluous luxuries when organized under a common cause. Although U.S.
            government’s propaganda based success to conserve resources at home was a fantastic
            accomplishment, it came with a disconcerting lesson. Without an enemy, Americans lost
            their capacity to skirt comforts for conservational purposes. As it happens, the
            overwhelming amount of research indicates that there still is an enemy — although it
            does not present itself in a swastika emblazoned SS jacket, but with climbing
            temperatures and rising sea levels — however a complicated mesh of conflicting interests
            seems to be hindering Americans from readopting the thrifty traits of their
            grandparents. The consequence is a culture that continues to increase its consumption,
            ignoring the all but certain consequences. As the speed at which items are deemed
            obsolete increases, driving the economy further toward a reliance on disposable
            commodities, the rate at which our landfills reach max capacity increases in step,
            despite our technological potential to accomplish the opposite. Further encouragement
            for America to deal more effectively with its waste addiction should come from an
            awareness of what is transpiring beyond its own shores. Population growth compounded
            with the entrance of developing countries in consumer markets guarantees that demand for
            first world commodities is to skyrocket. The amount of waste produced by such an
            increase in demand, spells uncertain questions for how factories and our environment
            will respond to this change. Luckily, a solution to our apathy might be found in new
            technologies. By levering technology to sort our waste for us, both in our home and in
            public, the current flow of thousands of tons of metals, rare earth and plastics could
            be directed out of our landfills rather than into them. This is crucial not only in
            ensuring that less waste reaches our landfills, but also in ensuring that what does
            reach our landfills does so safely. </problem_stmt>

            <background type="source">The aptly named Science Nordic is an independent news site,
                focused on the coverage of scientific developments in Nordic countries. As such, the
                coverage of automated waste assortment in Norway fits nicely into the domain of the
                website. </background>
            <summary type="general">A broad overview is given of new waste sorting technology at a
                waste disposal plant on the outskirts of Oslo. In addition to providing coverage of
                the capabilities of the plant (in sorting between plastic and food waste), the
                article also refers back to failures in similar technology that had been attempted
                in the 1980s.</summary>
            <summary type="approach">Although the implementations of the more primitive trash
                sorting robots dealt heavy costs to governments with little returns, the state of
                spectrography, infra-red sensors and hardware improvements have improved
                significantly. </summary>
            <summary type="interpretation">The article carries a hopeful tone both for the future of
                the Oslo plant, and for similar technologies in the world at large. </summary>
            <relevance type="value_stmt">Given the success of the technology in question, both in
                Norway and in other countries, one would hope that in 2016 this system for waste
                management would be ubiquitous and expanded upon. There is no evidence to suggest
                that this is the case, making the technology discussed still of pinnacle importance. </relevance>
            <relevance type="application">As such, the Oslo plant's sorting methods could work as a
                good example for engineers to take inspiration from in addition to communities who
                may be seeking to implement similar technologies. </relevance>

            <background type="author">The paper's authors are a group of multidisciplinary engineers
                based out of Bangladesh's Chittagong University and the University of Rajshashi. The
                talent of the engineers speaks for itself through the in-depth technical details
                provided on how they sought to address the automated sorting of recyclable
                goods.</background>
            <summary type="general">The paper is broken into eight sections. The authors open with a
                broad overview of the world's waste problem, followed by visual representations of
                potential resources that could be harvested from this waste. They then delve into
                the fine level details of their sorting system (capable of identifying paper, metal,
                glass and plastic), before resurfacing in the last three sections to discuss future
                plans, comparative studies and general conclusions. </summary>
            <summary type="approach">The technical solution -- detailed in sections three, four and
                five -- discusses a replicable system of OP Amps, IR, LDR, and several other
                components accompanied by flowcharts and explanations. </summary>
            <summary type="interpretation">Although the project in question doesn't address the
                issue of waste storage through a particularly novel approach, it is a logical one,
                and is fit for the task at hand. </summary>
            <relevance type="value_stmt">Undeniably there are many obvious grammatical issues
                present in the text, however to dismiss the work for such a triviality would be a
                mistake. A well researched and technically challenging solution to a serious problem
                is put on display that is worth consideration. </relevance>
            <relevance type="application">Any engineers looking for a highly detailed report on
                creating a control flow to develop a similar sensor based system could gain insight
                from reading this paper.</relevance>
