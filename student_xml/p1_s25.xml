            <background type="source"> This paper, which was created in an open classroom
                environment within the Sutardja Center for Entrepreneurship and Technology at UC
                Berkeley, provides an in depth examination on the current climate of package
                delivery using drones. </background>
            <summary type="general"> The authors, after looking at current strategies of relevant
                companies, technological capabilities, and limitations of delivery drones, conclude
                that the idea <q>will eventually be successful in the last mile delivery space
                </q>(17). </summary>
            <relevance type="application">While the report delves heavily into the financial aspect
                of the concept, it also provides a good summation of the current state of technology
                related to drone delivery. </relevance>
            <relevance type="application">In general, it is a good resource for those looking for
                current solutions for existing technical hurdles, such as battery life, charging
                technology and flight planning, as well as a list of relatively unsolved challenges
                such as weather resistance. </relevance>

            <background type="author"> This article, written by drone reporter Sally French,
                explores an already existing and successful drone delivery service from a tech
                startup called Matternet. </background>
            <summary type="general"> The article breaks the process of the delivery down step by
                step, detailing some of the technical capabilities of the drone, as well as the
                technical decisions made by the company to create a successful service. </summary>
            <relevance type="application">Though the drones were implemented to only delivery
                medically related supplies in other countries, such as Switzerland, Haiti, and the
                Dominican Republic, the company is a useful case study of what goes into the
                successful application of a similar drone delivery service in other parts of the
                world. </relevance>
