        <problem_stmt> One of the unsolved problems with living in a city such as Boston is the
            process of package delivery. If a package is being delivered to a dorm, or to an
            apartment while the resident is not at home to open the door, often times it is
            redirected to a different location to be picked up at a later time. This means that the
            recipient would have to take time out of his or her day to grab the package while the
            building is operating, and carry it all the way back to its intended location. This
            major inefficiency and inconvenience can be solved if the resident knows or controls
            exactly when the package is coming, or if it comes so quickly after ordering that the
            wait time is insignificant. These solutions can be realized through the use of drone
            technology, and the use of unmanned vehicles for delivery. Drones can send real time
            information to the recipient, can be activated at any time, and can arrive at the end
            location independently of the schedule of a mail delivery worker. The successful
            implementation of drones revolves heavily on the use of sensors, and the successful
            integration of the mechanical, electrical, and software components that make them work.
            In terms of technical hurdles, autonomous vehicles must have complex control systems
            that respond quickly to any and all obstacles. These characteristics are exactly what
            the mechatronics discipline deals with, and mechatronics engineers would be integral in
            the development of this idea that could positively benefit the lives of millions of
            people. </problem_stmt>
