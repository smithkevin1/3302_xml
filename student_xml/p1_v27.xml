        <problem_stmt>In Boston today any outdated public transporation system known as the MBTA is
        using older train cars to hold its passengers. The space in these cars fill up quickly and 
        eventually there is no where for these people to go.

            <summary type="general">takes a look at space situation with subway systems in America.
                The article first examines why subway cars are becoming so overcrowded in these American
            cities. Afterwards it looks at the solutions other cities like Paris, Tokyo and Toronto have done
            to fix this issue.</summary>
            <relevance type="application">What the author finds to be the best solution to improving the space
              in these subway cars is having gangway trains instead of the string of separate cars
              that attach to one and another.</relevance>
