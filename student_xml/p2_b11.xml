        <!-- Executive Summary, Page 3 -->
        <page type="exec_sum"> Northeastern University is well known for our
            exceptional co-op program. As it stands, we are not representing this 
            program well. The purpose of this project is to create a new web portal
            to replace the current MyNEU COOL. As a software studnet here at Northeastern
            University I am wholy committed to this project and believe it can be done in 
            a reasonable timeframe. There are few limitations to the project (The major
            being reliable co-op position liasons), and tangible benefits. The revamping
            of our web portal will put a new face on the NEU co-op search process and 
            encourage our students to use the service, in turn yeilding more support for
            our student feedback database and overall improvements to the co-op process on 
            the faculty and student end.

                is undertaken by the overwhelming majority of students, making this a very visible
                improvement on the part of the University. The goal is inpart to increase user feedback,
                make the process easier and more intuitive, overall replace and improve what is generally 
                considered a poor service.

        <page type="conc">       
            
            <fsb>The project is feasible. All of the students working on it have web development experience and with the provided timeframe of three months
                we are fully confident that this project can be completed, on time. The addition of student feedback throughout the process increases our ability
                to create the ideal improvements, securing the valuable student approval. We are also provided in-depth views for NEU staff and increasing our availabilty
                for feedback.</fsb>
            
            <cond>The only condiftion is that our timeline not be shortened. This timeline is already short for a standard web package development, and any attempts
                to rush the product compromise the result. That being said, the team is confident it can be delivered on time on the condition that new hardware is not 
                needed to host the service. In the event that we need to purchase new hardware the timeline may be increased, or we can look into external hosting.</cond>
            
            <sum> In summary, this project will provide Northeastern University with a valuable studnet experiential learning program and improve a widely used
                service. It is no secret that our current co-op database (MyNEU COOL) is antiquated, and studnet feedback is very low. By developing a replacement web
                portal and migrating all of the current data, we can improve that service without loosing any aspect of the service that students are accustomed too. 
                By minimizing changes to the current system's underworkings and instead "re-skinning" it, we can avoid a costly experience, and utilize our current
                system in the improvement.</sum>
