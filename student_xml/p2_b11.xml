        <!-- Executive Summary, Page 3 -->
        <page type="exec_sum"> Northeastern University is well known for our
            exceptional co-op program. As it stands, we are not representing this 
            program well. The purpose of this project is to create a new web portal
            to replace the current MyNEU COOL. As student here at Northeastern
            University I am wholly committed to this project and believe it can be done in 
            a reasonable time frame. Here is why: What we're talking about here is 
            mostly changing the interface and I believe the back end usability is already present, 
            it is just not utilized. There are few limitations to the project with the major
            limitation being reliable co-op position liaisons and tangible benefits for participants, 
            but this is outside of the feasibility of the application itself, and
            more related to general improvements. The revamping
            of our web portal will put a new face on the NEU co-op search process and 
            encourage our students to use the service, in turn yielding more support for
            our student feedback database and overall improvements to the co-op process on 
            the faculty and student end.

                project is to improve the overall quality of the co-op search process. This process
                is undertaken by the overwhelming majority of students, making this a very visible
                improvement on the part of the university. The goal is in part to increase user feedback,
                make the process easier and more intuitive, overall replace and improve what is generally 
                considered a poor service.

                This includes students from different majors collaborating for a full cross discipline
                project. This exemplifies Northeastern's experiential learning goals, and creates student
                involvement.

                and branding. The primary colors used will be Northeastern Red (CC0000), Warm Grey 
                11 (615445), and Black (000000), along with the thematic Northeastern header standard
                on all digital front end space.

                all archived jobs, all student reviews, and all stored student coop history, in whatever 
                format the database uses. This is make transition rather seamless, 
                and allow for users to keep the information they are accustomed too. The goal here
                is to prevent users from having to relearn a new system, rather they will immediately
                know how to use it.

            <fsb>The project is feasible. All of the students working on it have web development experience and with the provided time frame of three months
                we are fully confident that this project can be completed, on time. The addition of student feedback throughout the process increases our ability
                to create the ideal improvements, securing the valuable student approval. We are also provided in-depth views for NEU staff and increasing our availability
                for feedback.</fsb>
            
            <cond>The only condition is that our time line not be shortened. This time line is already short for a standard web package development, and any attempts
                to rush the product compromise the result. That being said, the team is confident it can be delivered on time on the condition that new hardware is not 
                needed to host the service. In the event that we need to purchase new hardware the time line may be increased, or we can look into external hosting.</cond>
            
            <sum> In summary, this project will provide Northeastern University with a valuable student experiential learning program and improve a widely used
                service. It is no secret that our current co-op database (MyNEU COOL) is antiquated, and student feedback is very low. By developing a replacement web
                portal and migrating all of the current data, we can improve that service without losing any aspect of the service that students are accustomed too. 
                By minimizing changes to the current system's under workings and instead "re-skinning" it, we can avoid a costly experience, and utilize our current
                system in the improvement.</sum>

        <report type="peer" resp="#c12">
            <p>This is a feasibility report on redoing the myNEU COOL co-op web application. It is a
            response to student's negative opinions of the current application which is in need of
            an overhaul.
            
            I think that my main issue is the lack of any feasibility section. I see requirements and success criteria, 
            but I don't see anything analyzing the actual feasibility of the project. 
            The feasibility is touched upon in different sections like requirements and success criteria 
            so a main feasibility section may feel redundant to you. Should the elements that make it
            feasible be explicitly layed out or should the reader be able to infer based on the requirements? We have 
            a page type="fsb" where one could list the different types of feasibility examined and this is
            what I used. I think that this is one of the most important sections where you can convince readers why it is 
            feasible or not depending on the current financial situation or current technical abilities of the students.
            
            A quick fix that I think you could add would be to add a subtitle of Feasibility Report to the 
            title page. Another simple fix: Table of Contents under Cost Estimate says Programmers but
            the section title is Developers. One thing that I like in your report is how everything seems to be bulleted or 
            within sections rather than in paragraphs. It makes the sections that you are highlighting 
            stand out and your point is clearly conveyed.
            
            In the executive summary, you say that as a software student, you're fully committed to the project
            and think that it could get done in a reasonable time frame. Reading from the outside this kind of 
            seems like there could be some bias in the paper. With yourself being committed to the project, it
            could seem like you would maybe want to over or under-represent the facts to make it seem like 
            the project is more feasible than it actually is. Perhaps a less personal approach to the paper
            would make sense.
            
            In the reporting section, we may want to ask Kevin to add dates for the different "tmln" elements,
            as they don't show up on the formatted document. Also, we may want to ask Kevin to allow multiple "reqt_sect"
            elements in the Success criteria section, as Oxygen is saying your second one isn't valid.
