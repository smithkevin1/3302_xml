        <page type="exec_sum">A network linked traffic signal control system is proposed throughout
            the city of Boston. The network will autonomously adjust traffic signal timing depending
            on the current traffic conditions using a neural network. The goal of using autonomously
            adjusting traffic signals as opposed to timed signals is to reduce the amount of time
            spent in traffic in the city. Less time spent in traffic will result in lower fossil
            fuel emissions as well as a higher quality of life for commuters. The current traffic
            signal system in Boston is well set up to be adapted to take on the neural network
            traffic control system. </page>

        <page type="pre_req_ana">
            <app_ovr type="obj">The objective of the proposed system is to provide an overall
                decrease in traffic throughout the city of Boston, especially during peak travel
                times.</app_ovr>
            <app_ovr type="synergy"> The proposed system will utilize the current traffic control
                system which has central control of 544 of 845 lights operated by the Boston
                Transportation Department as shown in their 2013 annual report. The program will
                also utilize several sensors present at major intersections throughout the
                city.</app_ovr>
            <app_ovr type="rls">The proposed system will have to comply will all state and federal
                laws regarding traffic signals.</app_ovr>
        </page>

        <page type="fsb">
            <fsb_hlgt type="tcnl"> The proposed neural network will require several improvements to
                the current control system. Currently, most traffic signals are controlled by preset
                timers. These timers are set by traffic control engineers once every five years
                after observing traffic for several days. The other traffic signals use both the
                timers and some sensors to determine how many cars are currently at the
                intersection. For the neural network traffic system, three major actions will need
                to take place. First, the remaining 301 of 845 lights will need to be connected to
                the central traffic system. This will allow the central program to control all
                lights in the city. Second, sensors will have to be placed at large intersections in
                the city. These sensors will tell the neural network how many cars are at major
                intersections and allow the network to adjust traffic flow depending on the
                conditions. The sensors can be applied either on traffic poles as visual sensors or
                underneath the pavement as pressure sensors. As there will be a fairly large number
                of sensors, most will have to be applied to poles as digging up roads will increase
                the implementation time and budget of the project. Last, the neural network will
                need to be implemented. This neural network will be connected to all of the traffic
                lights and receive the sensor data from the main intersections. The network can
                leverage several papers already written on the subject of traffic control with
                neural networks.<note type="instructor" resp="#kgs">Are these papers you refernce
                    elsewhere?</note>
            </fsb_hlgt>
            <fsb_hlgt type="econ">The effective costs of the project will go to three categories:
                connecting the lights to the central network, adding sensors to main intersections,
                and coding the neural network. The majority of the cost will go towards the
                development of the neural network. Based on the Boston Transportation Department's
                current budget, there is a sizeable amount of money that could be allocated towards
                these purposes each year over the course of the next five years. </fsb_hlgt>

        <page type="rsk_ana"> There are several potential risks to this system. One risk is lights
            getting disconnected from the central system. This can be combated by having preset
            timers as backups to the network timing. Preset timers is the current format, so this
            backup would not add much extra work to the system. Another risk is the introduction of
            self-driving cars. Self-driving cars may eliminate the need for traffic signals which
            would prove the system useless. In order for traffic signals to become useless, however,
            all cars would need to be autonomous. This is not likely to happen, as normal cars are
            so engrained in our society that there will always be people that want to drive cars or
            that will be too afraid of self-driving cars to own one. There will always be people
            that want to drive antique cars that will not be autonomous. </page>

        <page type="conc">
            <fsb>Given the current budget and technology, it appears to be reasonable to complete
                this task within the proposed five year time frame. With much research already done
                on the subject of neural networks, it would be reasonable to create over the course
                of several years.</fsb>
            <cond>Despite budget concerns throughout the city, this would be a good allocation of
                funds to increase the quality of life of workers around the area.</cond>
            <sum>The project appears to be technically feasible in that all proposed actions can be
                completed given the correct time and resources. Given some room added in the Boston
                Transportation Department's budget, there is also enough monetary resources for the
                project to work. Last, the large time period proposed for the project will allow the
                system to be implemented in a timely manner. Overall, it appears reasonable that the
                system can be implemented.</sum>

            <p> After reading this feasibility report about the traffic lights neural network, I can
                see that the feasibility report is well organized and easy to understand. After a
                glance, the report looks feasible. It looks like the author is trying to make the
                Boston’s traffic signal more efficient. I don’t understand where does the number 544
                of traffic lights come from? It doesn’t have any explanation of it. It has two
                feasibility pages which I’m confused so I went through the XML page and realized
                that they are in different types. I feel like it can be one page with two
                paragraphs. In this draft, it doesn’t have the report page and financial page. I
                think it won’t hurt to have these two pages since they are the part of the schema
                and may influence the audience’s decision after they read the report. In the risk
                analysis page, the author should not only mention the risk but also explain how will
                this project reduce some of the risk. You can’t let people know the risk but no
                solving plans to it. Also, how is the current Boston traffic signal set up? Why does
                it need to be changed into a neural network? I think it will be better if the author
                mentioned these. The author uses most of the schema in the same way that we think
                when we develop the schema. In the success criteria, I’m not sure it we need more
                words to explain it or just do the same as the author did in bullet points? The
                schema is well formed and easy to use, thus, the rules of the schema is easy to
                follow as the author did. </p>

            <p>I like that you continued this project from the annotated bibliogrpahy; I feel like
                the feasibility report really invites this kind continuation. As far as your
                report--I think the strength is in the clarity of the writing and the detail--this
                is particularly evident in the success criteria and report pages, which are very
                well done. I also think you responded and revised in a productive way following peer
                review. One question I have (and this maybe goes back to schema design) is about how
                sources are generally cited in this genre? I see some areas where specific numbers,
                etc. are used that I would assume have an accompanying reference. These are small
                issues, though. On the whole this is very well done.</p>
