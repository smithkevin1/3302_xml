            <p>The MBTA was created in 1964 to replace the Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA). The
                MBTA is the fourth largest public transportation system in the country, averaging
                1.3 million riders on a weekday, and is responsible for operating the commuter rail,
                subway and bus systems in Boston. The Green Line is the single busiest subway system
                in the country and averages over 250,000 riders a day. The MBTA is the single
                largest consumer of electricity in the state and is used by 33% of workers in the
                city proper as their primary method of commuting. Given Boston's high dependence on
                the public transportation system, it is essential for the subway to operate
                efficiently for commuters to reach their place of work and for the economic success
                of the city of Boston. However, in recent years the MBTA has suffered a variety of
                incidents that highlight the major problems with the system and show that
                improvements must be made. The MBTA is $8 billion dollars in debt and has put off
                much needed maintenance due to budget concerns. As a result, the MBTA has become a
                poorly run organization has numerous issues with all aspects of their operation<note type="instructor" resp="#kgs">wow, this feels like a strong assertion; will the people reading your proposal be part of MBTA or know people in it? Are there reasons you wouldn't want to be so accusatory here?</note>.
                However, the most frequent complaints about the MBTA are centered around the subway
                system and rightly so. The subway system is outdated, overcrowded and often delayed
                due to technical issues. If Boston is going to continue to be a modern city that
                seeks to reduce the consumption of fossil fuels by supporting public transportation,
                the subway system must be updated<note type="instructor" resp="#kgs">I really like this formulation--in some ways it creates a situation to which they must respond (in the way that you want them to).</note>.</p>
        </intro>

        <background>
            <p>
                <crnt_cond> The Boston subway system can only be described as old. The four main
                    lines in the city, the Red Line, Green Line, Orange Line and Blue Line all use
                    cars that were constructed prior to 1990. While all the lines use older subway
                    cars, the Red Line is the worst as, <q>"Out of the MBTA's 218 Red Line cars, 132
                        are over 25 years old." (Annear)</q>. The Orange Line cars were all
                    implemented between 1979-1981 and have not undergone any major upgrades since,
                    and a majority the of Green Line fleet has been in operation since the 1980's.
                    These cars were never meant to accommodate the heavy commuter traffic they
                    support daily and depend on outdated forms of technology that often fail and
                    create delays, interrupting the city's economy. </crnt_cond>
                <subj_hist> The problems of the MBTA subway system were especially apparent during
                    the winter of 2014-2015, when Boston received record snowfall levels that
                    paralyzed the city. The frequent storms resulted in massive subway delays and
                    the complete closure of the sections of the Red, Orange and Green lines that
                    were above ground. These delays were mainly caused by engine failure, as the
                    older cars utilize Direct Current (DC) systems that struggle in the snow and
                    freezing temperatures. Cities such as New York have resolved this problem by
                    implementing cars using Alternating Current systems, which are more capable of
                    handling inclement weather. Furthermore, the state of the subway system was a
                    major reason that the citizens of Boston rejected consideration to host the 2024
                    Summer Olympics as it was widely believed the MBTA was incapable of handling the
                    surge of riders in its current state and incapable of securing the funding for
                    the necessary improvements if the Olympic bid progressed (Manning).<note type="instructor" resp="#kgs">this is an excellent source to use here</note> The state of
                    the subway system in Boston negatively impacts the economy, environment and the
                    society in which we live and must be provided with significant investment to
                    allow Boston to continue to develop into a truly modern and green city.

                <scope type="what"> Massachusetts must provide the MBTA with significant funding to
                    completely overhaul the subway system to implement much needed improvements that
                    will allow the subway to operate efficiently.</scope>
                <scope type="who"> The Massachusetts legislature has consistently left the MBTA
                    underfunded since 2000 when it imposed a cap on their budget due to serious
                    concerns about financial mismanagement at the MBTA. As a result, the MBTA has
                    been forced to delay major improvements until such time when they receive the
                    necessary funding, causing the subway's infrastructure to fall into
                    disrepair.<note type="instructor" resp="#kgs">but does the City of Boston have any control over this? How does this align with your audience?</note></scope>
                <scope type="when">The MBTA has maintained the subway system with small projects
                    meant to improve one or two stations at a time and make temporary fixes to the
                    outdated rail cars. However, this cannot continue indefinitely and the State
                    Legislature must allocate the appropriate funding to modernize the subway system
                    as soon as possible.</scope>
                <!--attribute options: what, who, when, where-->
                <objective> The main objectives of this project are to replace all cars constructed
                    prior to 1990 with modern cars, repair the subway tracks and stations, and
                    extend the subway lines to accommodate additional riders once the system is
                    capable of handling the increase in traffic. </objective>
                <goal> By improving the efficiency and service of the MBTA subway system, more
                    commuters will choose to use public transportation as their primary means of
                    transportation. The subsequent reduction of the amount of cars driving into the
                    city each days will make Boston a greener, more environmentally friendly city as
                    it will reduce the amount of fossil fuels required for the city to function.
                    Increased use of an efficient subway system that gets workers to their places of
                    business on time will improve the standard of living in the city and reduce the
                    anger caused daily by traffic delays.

                </goal>
            </p>
        </purpose>

        <approach>
            <!--attribute options: execution, action-->
            <p>
                <action>To modernize the subway system, the MBTA must first be granted the necessary
                    funds to purchase modern cars that are better suited for Boston's harsh winter
                    conditions and can accommodate more passengers. Boston has purchased 284
                    replacement cars for the Red and Orange lines from a Chinese company but this
                    deal now faces scrutiny and an investigation following accusations of unfair
                    business practices as CRRC, a Chinese State-subsidized company, was able to
                    undercut their American competitors (Metzger). Even if this deal is allowed to
                    proceed, there is still a large portion of the subway system that has not yet
                    received funding for renovations. The State Legislature must be petitioned to
                    allocate $3.2 billion in funding to the MBTA to implement the necessary repairs
                    and improvements to the subway system (Vaccaro). Approval of this funding may
                    require a public marketing campaign to persuade the residents of the greater
                    Boston area that the benefits from improving of the subway system outweigh the
                    costs.<note type="instructor" resp="#kgs">OK, this makes sense</note> Once funding has been secured, new cars using modern AC technology will
                    be purchased from a reliable company with a proven record and implemented as
                    soon as they are constructed. While the cars are being built, the subway
                    stations and lines should undergo renovations and extensions to be finished
                    prior to the delivery of the new subway cars. When the cars are completed,
                    Boston will have a fully functional, modern and reliable subway system, capable
                    of handling a greater capacity of riders and inclement weather.</action>
            </p>
        </approach>

        <feasibility>
            <!--attribute options: economic, social, environmental, cannot add more than 1 feasbility section?-->
            <p>
                <economic>In the 2016 Capital Investment Report, the MBTA had programmed $1.05
                    billion towards their Capital Investment Program (MBTA 2016 CIP). However, over
                    63% of this funding or $666 million is allocated to State of Good Repair costs,
                    or the cost to maintain the current state of the MBTA. Only 10% has been
                    designated for the modernization and expansion of the MBTA system, most of which
                    is meant for the subway system. With such a low percentage of the funding
                    allocated towards modernization, the MBTA will consistently lag behind modern
                    technology. Additional funding must be granted to the MBTA through the increased
                    allocation of taxpayer money and revenue collection. This will meet significant
                    resistance due to the MBTA's past financial mismanagement and fundamental ethics
                    issues involving huge pension payments, absenteeism and corruption. However,
                    these fears can be mitigated by Gov. Charlie Baker's recent overhaul of the
                    MBTA's Governing Board that involves increased oversight from Beacon Hill. The
                    MBTA has also raised fares and is enforcing the collection of them more
                    consistently on the commuter rails, increasing their revenues. The economic
                    benefits of an upgraded subway system are numerous. Most importantly, an
                    efficient transportation system that does not suffer from frequent delays will
                    not interrupt the business of the city. During the winter of 2015, it was
                    estimated the a statewide travel ban would result in a loss of $265 million a
                    day, and the complete shutdown of the MBTA several times that winter resulted in
                    the loss of hundreds of millions of dollars in profits for businesses in Boston.
                    The estimated total loss in business revenues of over $1 billion during the
                    winter of 2014 justifies the allocation of $3.2 billion over the next seven
                    years for the modernization and expansion of the subway system. An overhaul of
                    the T system would result in fewer economic interruptions and make Boston a more
                    attractive location for economic development, which would provide more jobs and
                    opportunity for the citizens of Boston.<note type="instructor" resp="#kgs">this is compelling</note></economic></p>
        </feasibility>

        <conclu>
            <p> Funding the suggested repairs in this proposal will greatly benefit the citizens,
                businesses and culture of the City of Boston in the years to come. By improving the
                efficiency of the subway by funding modern technology, the T's capacity and
                reliability will be increased, resulting in more commuters utilizing its services.
                This will reduce the amount of cars traveling into the city each day and lower the
                amount of carbon pollutants released by cars. This will make Boston an
                environmentally friendly city capable of accommodating larger crowds such as those
                seen during the Olympics, which would provide further economic opportunity to the
                city.</p>

            <p>I like the thread of exigence you pull through the proposal: i.e. that in order to continue to be considered a modern city, Boston *must* respond to this public transportation issue. I also particularly enjoyed the economic argument that drew on the amount lost/spent during the snow storm and the economic development opportunities lost as a result of the inefficient system. My one major question is your audience--if MA controls funding to the MBTA, then why is your audience the City of Boston? Even if you convince them to replace the cars as you want, they may not control the capital required to udertake this project. I could imagine a proposal to the Commonwealth, but that would change a lot of the exigence you create.</p>
