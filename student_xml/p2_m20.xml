            The App is called Waitless and it's designed for helping people get a seat for a restaurant which doesn't take reservations
            so that they don't need to be arrived and wait for 45 minutes. If you always have dinner outside in Boston, you may find this 
            situation very common. This new app is going to short the waiting time. After you download this app on your phone and the restaurant 
            also has this app downloaded on their device, the time saving trip is started. You can start to wait when you heading to the place 
            and you can see the waiting time so that you can check the time and decide which place you want to go. It's smiliar when you check 
            the route on Google Map and the app will tell you that how long will it take for you to get there and how long is the waiting time. 
            It's a combination of Google Map, Yelp and waiting time of all the restaurants. Also, it can make the points card electronical.

                For now, people need to go to the restaurant first, get in a line if it’s busy there, and wait until your turn. Since 
                there won’t be enough space for customers to wait inside the restaurant, you will have to wait outside. In Boston, the 
                winter is cold and long, by long, I mean 6 months of a year. In possibility, there will be 50% of times that you wait for 
                food is going to be in the cold winter. Some of the restaurants call by name which means you can’t leave. Some of restaurants 
                use the “buzz thing” to let you know your turn but you can’t stay too far from the restaurant. After installing Waitless, 
                all these problems solved! No need for waiting outside in the wind for a long time and you can plan your time for your meal. 
                Besides, you don’t need to carry all the points cards with you or getting more points cards if you didn’t bring your own.

                In order to develop an App like this, we need to understand how does a restaurant calculate the time. Also, the other 
                problem is that how can we make everything live. Making the points card electronic is the easy part, as long as the 
                restaurant has some kind of points card. A good way to develop the calculating the time is that every restaurant has 
                its own average of dinning time for every numbers of party. As long as we have the average, it will be easy to calculate 
                time. The App is a live based App which means it will sync the changes at backend every few seconds.

            The risk of this App is the lack of users. The way to avoid it is to send advertisements in popular restaurants around Boston. 
            The App is free first 6-months to restaurants so that they will get to know it well and starting using it.

            <fnc type="fund"> The cost of developing the ISO APP is the cost of human. It may need 3 person to get all these done. 
            One for the GUI design for the customer side, one for GUI design for the restaurant side and the last one is to get all the 
            data from customer and restaurants. There will be no more cost other than people. Thus, developing a software doesn't need 
            huge funds. </fnc>

            <fsb>This App is a feasible application. According to the design, this App should be capable on IOS and Android.</fsb>
            <cond>On the restaurant side, most of them have one device to take waiting list, other wise, it needs a person to 
                count the tables and calculate the time. If we can make it as a App, things are going to be a lot much easier. 
                On the customer side, with this App, it will save a lot of time. Instead of waiting outside the restaurant 
                in the cold freezing weather, it's better to have an App like this to get on the waiting list before you arrive. </cond>
            <sum> This Waitless will give both customers and restaurants convenience and help them save time.</sum>
