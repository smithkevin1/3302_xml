        <greeting>Dear Hiring Committee: </greeting>

        <intro_para>
            <intent type="Purpose">I am writing to apply for the MotorSports development engineer
                position at A123 Systems Inc. listed in NUCareers.</intent>
            <reason>I am thrilled to see progress being made into the future of clean energy in the
                automotive industry. I am also most driven in a work environment that keeps me on my
                toes with both business development work and engineering based problem
                solving.</reason>
            <proposition>I think my experience working for both well established engineering
                companies and fast paced start ups that are still establishing themselves gives me a
                unique set of skills that are useful in process development.</proposition>
        </intro_para>

        <para_background>
            <experience type="work">At my first co-op at Amphenol PCD, I was introduced to the types
                of standards that needed to be met to serve customers in the military and aerospace
                industries. I produced and followed standard operating procedures created by
                companies like Raytheon and Boeing in the process of developing and supplying
                quality electrical products for their assemblies. The rigorous standards implemented
                at this job taught me the importance of well organized and effective documentation
                of everything involved in an engineering company. It also taught me how necessary it
                was to work creatively within the bounds of these SOPs in order to pruduce quality
                end products. This job is also where I became accomplished using 3D modeling and
                rapid prototyping programs such as Pro-E/Creo and 3D printing.</experience>
        </para_background>

        <para_background>
            <experience type="work">In my experience working at Infinium, Inc., a material science
                start up, I learned all about process development in a research environment. At this
                company I worked on a small team to refine a process to create primary aluminum via
                electrochemical processes. I modelled in AutoCAD inventor and helped to build
                infrastructure for the developing process. I also performed material compatability
                tests and post experiment analysis using x-ray diffraction, scanning electron
                microscopy, and data analysis in MatLab. </experience>
        </para_background>

        <para_background>
            <experience type="school">Aside from my work experience, I am a recent student at a
                University that emphasizes professional development and entrepreneurship. In my labs
                and classes, I have developed strong technical writing and communication skills, the
                ability to work effectively with teams of people, and resourceful problem solving
                skills.</experience>
        </para_background>

        <para_closing>
            <compatability>I believe I work best in a fast paced, energetic environment and think I
                would be able to integrate well into a team like A123 Systems'
                MotorSports.</compatability>
            <next_step>I would welcome the opportunity to futher discuss the position and my
                qualifications in the near future. Thank you very much for your
                consideration!</next_step>
