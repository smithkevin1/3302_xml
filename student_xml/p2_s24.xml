            <misconception> The words somehow feel like they belong to two types of people: 1)
                Malicious computer hackers who can cause servers to melt worldwide with the casual
                swipe of their fingers and a sip of mountain dew. 2) The office IT worker who can

                Hutt's mafioso control of Tatooine's water supplies. </misconception>
            Consequentially, when the topic of computer security arises, the average computer user's
            eyes glaze over whilst simultaneously running away at Olympic gold medal speeds. <pb/>
            This is bad. We (almost) all use computers, and its our responsibility to help keep them
            safe. <analogy>Who's at fault if you get in an car accident when you're driving without
                a license?<note type="peer">Replace w/ ?</note> Who's at fault if you leave your
                door open every day and come home one day to find out you've been robbed? </analogy>
            A lot of your important stuff exists on a computer somewhere. <important_idea n="1">
                What you might not know, is that avoiding having this stuff stolen is not hard nor
                time intensive;<note type="peer">Replace w/ ;</note> it can be as easy as putting on
                a seatbelt or locking your door.</important_idea><pb/>
            <question>So how do we make sure that our computers are secure?</question><pb/>We'll get
            to that shortly, but first let's understand why we are in a state of constant cyber
            threat. <list type="roadmap"> Better understanding <section_header>why there is
                danger</section_header> will help us create a plan for <section_header>stopping
                    danger</section_header>. </list><pb/>
            <section_header> Why There is Danger</section_header><pb/> If we negated threats
            stemming from the internet, the world wouldn't be devoid of cyber-danger, however the
            vast majority of problems would not exist. <technical_principle n="1">There is nothing
                inherently scary about the internet, all it is, is the ability to transmit data
                between computers. <analogy>If we think of a computer as a person, the internet is
                    what gives it the ability to speak to any other person in the world. </analogy>
            </technical_principle> The only issue with this, is that when the researchers who were
            designing what would one day be referred to as 'the internet' were working, they assumed
            that the world was this : <visual type="drawing" url="http://i.imgur.com/z8OdXVo.png"
            /><pb/> when it is really sometimes closer to this : <visual type="drawing"
                url="http://i.imgur.com/Gj0E8SD.png">Dystopia</visual><pb/> Consequentially, all the
            security of the internet was not built into its underlying functionality at the time of
            its creation, but has been added in layers since then. While programmers do a great job
            of ensuring our data stays safe, <analogy>the situation is akin to a treadmill in which
                we must develop safety measures more quickly than bad guys can figure out how to
                subvert them.</analogy><pb/> While it is concerning to think of such a volatile
            battle for internet supremacy being waged of which you are victim to, as it happens you
            are not unable to fight in it. The largest issue here at present however, is the
            computer industry's failing at communicating to users how they should focus on defending
            themselves. For example, take this graphic : <visual type="other"

            <analogy>What if those "6 pack abs in 6 minutes" products actually worked? What if they
                were also free? You'd give it a go, right? Well, beefing up your security is kind of

            <explanation>The degree of sophistication in your implementation of these features is
                likely determined by the value of the data that you are protecting. If you're the

                concepts and have them existing on your computer and in your home network at some
                degree. The firewall stops internet evil-doers from ever reaching your computer,
                should these evil-doers "get" to your computer, a secure configuration makes sure
                that the number of doors leading into your computer are limited, malware protection
                will alert you if an evil-doer has managed to enter your computer, and patching your
                software helps to ensure that what the evil-doer can do once on the inside is
                limited. <analogy>Together these features are the equivalent of washing your hands.

            <conclusion>
                <section_header>Be safe out there!</section_header><pb/>We tend to think of
                malicious programmers as working in late night hours to crack our security defenses.
                While in certain cases this might be the case, <important_idea n="4">for the vast
                    majority of cases this is not so. Most in-home security breaches occur because
                    there are known security flaws that malicious hackers exploit.</important_idea>b
                While even being aware of these steps isn't going to make you 100% impervious to the
                evil-doers of the internet, there is one last thing you've now got going for you.
                <visual type="comic" url="http://i.imgur.com/48SHE61.jpg">Sheep and

                bear, just faster than your slowest friend. Even for an internet evil-doer, stealing
                data can be difficult. Luckily for the internet evil-doers, the average internet
                user isn't properly protected. There are plenty of unarmed sheep in the world, so
                they're much less likely to waste their time on you if you take even the most basic
                measures toward security.</conclusion>

            <p>
                <summary> Oliver’s scientific post covers the dangers of an insecure computer and
                    ways you can prevent these dangers through simple measures (having strong
                    passwords that change every free months, removing any unused accounts or
                    applications, giving accounts the minimum requirements to function, keeping up
                    with updates, conducting regular scans, etc.). </summary>
                <critique> Oliver’s topic is relevant to our genre since computer security is a
                    subject that people generally fail to take note of. He does a good job
                    explaining why keeping your computer secure is important and separating out how
                    we should go about fixing technical insecurities. I liked how he wrote "Your
                    computer in 4 hours" to compare it to the four steps. The image following that
                    part seemed a little off since it had 5 symbols (though I do see how he places
                    "Boundary firewalls and internet gateways" with "Secure configuration"). I also
                    liked how he introduced an analogy at the beginning of each section. It would be
                    good if he referred to a site that provided good reviews and recommendations to
                    good anti-malware programs. He wraps the piece up with the conclusion well by
                    informing readers that the steps aren’t difficult and that they only need to be
                    more secure than the regular user to be a bit safer. I think this is good since
                    people are more likely to act on something that doesn’t take much effort. It
                    would be good if he lead into the links at the end - something like, "If you're
                    interested in learning more about ..." </critique>
