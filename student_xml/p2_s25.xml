        <greeting>Dear Joshua Elvander,</greeting>
        <intro_para>
            <intent type="Purpose">I am writing to express my interest in the mechanical engineering
                fall internship position, which I found through Northeastern's Co-op
                network.</intent>
            <reason> I am approaching my fourth year as a BS/MS candidate for Mechanical Engineering
                and am eager to gain more experience before graduation.</reason>
            <proposition>I believe my previous experience and strong interest in the automation
                industry make me an ideal candidate for this role.</proposition>
        </intro_para>
        <para_background>
            <!-- One or More -->
            <experience type="work">During my time at Portal Instruments, also a startup in the
                area, I worked on a complex electromechanical assembly.</experience>
            <experience type="work"> This project involved a lot of design, fabrication, and
                testing, which I believe is not unlike the work I would be doing at
                Piaggio.</experience>
            <experience type="work">At my last co-op at Bio-Rad, I worked mostly independently on a
                piece of automation equipment, which involved the integration of mechanical,
                electrical, and software concepts.</experience>
        </para_background>
        <para_background>
            <experience type="school">I am currently studying to have a concnetration in
                Mechatronics and am strongly interested in all things automation and
                interdisciplinary.</experience>
            <experience type="personal">In addition to my work experience, I also participate in
                AIAA, where I have begun to help with the mechanical design of an RC plane as well
                as the implementation of several sensors.</experience>
        </para_background>

        <para_closing>
            <compatability>Additionally, I am a motivated worker and would fit in well with the
                start up environment of Piaggio.</compatability>
            <next_step>I would appreciate an opportunity to meet with you to discuss my
                qualification in further detail.</next_step>
