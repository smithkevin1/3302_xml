        <greeting>Dear Joshua Elvander,</greeting>

        <intro_para>
            <intent type="Purpose">I am writing to express my interest in the mechanical engineering
                fall internship position, which I found through Northeastern's co-op
                network.</intent>
            <reason> I am approaching my fourth year as a BS/MS candidate for Mechanical Engineering
                with a concentration in Mechatronics and am eager to gain more hands-on experience
                in new industries.</reason>
            <proposition>I believe my previous experience and passion for automation and
                interdisciplinary work make me an ideal candidate for this role.</proposition>

            <experience type="work">During my time at Portal Instruments, another start up in the
                area, I worked on a complex electromechanical assembly.</experience>
            <experience type="work"> This project involved a lot of independent design, fabrication,
                and testing, which I believe is not unlike the work I would be doing at
                Piaggio.</experience>
            <experience type="work">At my last co-op at Bio-Rad, I worked mostly independently on a
                piece of automation equipment, which involved the integration of mechanical,
                electrical, and software concepts.</experience>
            <experience type="personal">In addition to my work experience, I also participate in
                AIAA, where I have begun to help with the mechanical design of an RC plane as well
                as the electrical and software implementation of several components.</experience>
        </para_background>

        <para_closing>
            <compatability> My previous supervisors have described me as a self motivated worker
                with an eagerness to learn, which I believe would make me a great fit for the start
                up environment of Piaggio.</compatability>
            <next_step>I would appreciate an opportunity to meet with you to discuss my
                qualifications in further detail. Thank you for your consideration, and I look
                forward to speaking with you soon.</next_step>

        1)	What is going well?
        The cover letter is not too difficult of a document to write, and its seem to have a fairly decent flow at this point.  I am pretty satisfied with my intro and closing paragraph.    
        
        2)	What has been difficult so far?
        I have found it difficult to try to figure out what to include and not include about myself, as well as the level of detail I should be elaborating on my experiences.  I have always had a challenging time talking about myself, so the background paragraph has probably been the most difficult.
        
        3)	Where are you in your process?
        I have completed a draft which I would be ok with sending to the company if I had to, but I would like to add more information and possibly refine some of my vocabulary and sentence structure.  
        
        4)	Specific areas/aspects of the draft (2-3)
        The background paragraph is the most important part of the document in my opinion, so I would like to focus on improving or adding upon it.  Many, if not most of the cover letters we looked at had two paragraphs for this part so it might make sense to try to add one.
