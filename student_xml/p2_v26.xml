            The system outlined in this study is a distributed method for the collection of weather-related data. The system consists of a network of micro-controllers with attached sensors to measure temperature and pressure. Associated with this system is a web application for the viewing and acquisition of collected data. The distributed nature of the system allows for a more granular view of weather data, allowing for better reporting and prediction of weather patterns. In addition, this system will attempt to be as open as possible as to effect the best possible analysis.
            
            Based on preliminary research, this project is feasible.

                The primary functionality provided is a system that collects weather data, specifically temperature and pressure, in a highly distributed manner. Micro-controllers will host the sensors that directly collect data; they will also contain networking functionality in order to send data to a centralized database. The data will be exposed to the public via a web application. Features provided by the web application include direct download of the data and visualizations based on the data.

                This project has two broad components, the sensor and the web applications. The sensor portion is composed of a micro-controller and multiple sensors. The micro-controller will also have some form of network connection and possibly some form of rudimentary data filtering mechanism. Network connectivity will be in the form of an ad-hoc network between all of the devices, with certain devices used as "exit nodes" which connect to the internet at large in order to upload to a central database and, by extension, the web application. Sensors to be included are for temperature (thermometer) and pressure (barometer). Data sent to the central database will be a timestamp, location data, and the data collected by the sensors. The web application is build on top of a database containing the data sent from the sensors. The two main features for the web application are data download and visualization creation.

                Sensors
                <req>
                    Micro-Controller: The base platform, essentially a small computer which provides power to all of the other components. It also may contain some basic data filtering software in order to prune noise from the collected data.
                </req>
                <req>
                    Network Connectivity: The sensors will be connected via an ad-hoc network model. In this model, most units will only be connected to other units. Pre-programed into each unit, will be the routing data which provides a path to a unit that has connection to the actual internet (an "exit node"). Thus, each unit will push its data towards the unit that is "closer" to an "exit node" until the data is pushed to the database.
                </req>
                <req>
                    Temperature Sensor: A basic thermometer, this will collect the temperature at an appropriate precision.
                </req>
                <req>
                    Pressure Sensor: A barometer, this will collect pressure data at an appropriate precision.
                </req>
                <req>
                    Location Data: In order for the system to work, each sensor must have its own location. This will be programmed in upon installation, likely in the form of a latitude, longitude pair.

                Web Application
                <req>
                    User Interface: The user interface should provide easy and intuitive access to all of the functionality provided. The interface should be optimized for use on desktop computers of all screen sizes. It also should have at least the basic ability to be used on mobile devices.
                </req>
                <req>
                    Data Download: Data download is the ability to pull ranges of data and possibly all data from the database. Also provided is the ability to download data in many different formats.
                </req>
                <req>
                    Visualizations: This feature will create various forms of visual representations of the data. This includes map overlays of the data, animations of the data, and various charts that show changes in the data over time.

                This sensors could use many commercial off the shelf products. For the micro-controller, an Arduino based chip could be used. These kinds of controllers are widely available and have the additional advantage of being open-source.The cheapest appropriate model would be rather expensive at fifteen to twenty dollars, but that price could go down as the boards are bought in bulk. Sensors provided by the Arduino project could also be used. A temperature sensor costs around one dollar and fifty cents and a pressure sensor costs around five dollars. Both of these prices, as with the chip, could go down with bulk purchases. The most expensive piece of equipment to buy would be network connectivity module, which would likely cost more than twenty dollars. Assuming a cost of twenty dollars for both the chip and the network module, this adds up to an overall cost of about forty seven dollars per unit. This price seems quite restrictive on the surface, but the price could decrease with bulk pricing and/or the possible development of specialized micro-controllers.

                The costs for the web application consist of payment to developers and hosting fees.

                Based on preliminary research, this project seems to be technologically feasible. From a practical perspective, these systems should be designed to be deployed in small segments, e.g., a neighborhood, as deploying in a entire city at one time would be fiscally and technically challenging.
            </fsb>

            <cond>
                The main hurdle to any actual implementation of this project is funding. A significant amount of the funding to this project would likely need to be public. The need for public funding necessitates a campaign in order to drum up general support for this project. 
            </cond>
            
            <sum>
                This is a project that would provide more granular and open granular weather data. The described implementation is made of commercially available, common parts. This system is quite feasible in the current environment.
