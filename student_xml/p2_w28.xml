                <crnt_cond> Located at 111 Waverly Way in Kirkland, City Center Park currently
                    serves as the city's second largest communal gathering space within city limits.
                    The large expanse of land has become overgrown with weeds and blackberry bushes.

                <subj_hist> As the site of the former junior high school which burned down in 1987,
                    this land was left in disrepair for over a year before members of the local
                    neighborhoods banned together to bring purpose back to the land. Over the years
                    since the fire, different features have been added progressively. Starting with
                    the creation of the winding path up to a senic lookout point over Lake
                    Washington and then building a small play ground out of local recycled
                    materials. The potential of this space is obvious to those who live around

                <scope type="when"> In the summer of 2017, the city of Kenmore hopes to begin
                    construction on the vacant lot turned community park in hopes of realizing its
                    value to the community and the organizations within it. </scope>

                    city and to its residence in many forms. </scope>
                <objective> The proposed project includes a multi-purpose turf sports feild with
                    small grandstand seating to serve as a practice area and play space for local
                    teams. It will include a ecofriendly play space by updating and reinforcing the
                    existing structure made out of local recycled materials. The existing lookout
                    point at the top of the park's hill will be enhanced with a sculptural totem
                    pole designed and carved by local artists and craftsman. All of which will be
                    surrounded by patches of community gardens for town residents to manage and
                    attend to. <!-- can include <q> element(s) for quoted material -->

                <goal> The goals of redesigning city center park are to: - Preserve, protect, and
                    improve parkland and recreational opportunities. - Anticipate the needs of the
                    changing community and structure programs and facilities accordingly. - Enhance
                    the cityâ€™s arts, cultural and historic assets. - Enrich the lives of residents.
                    - And build a healthier community. </goal>

            <p> Economic: Over the past five years the city of Kirkland has set aside a small budget
                each year to be put towards city redevelopment and improvement projects. Although
                this fund will not cover the entire cost of the project, it along with a number of
                donations from members of the community and local companies will cover the
                relatively low costs of this project. Much of the groundwork for this park has
                already been laid over the past 20 to 30 years through the small neighborhood
                improvement projects that have taken place. The main cost for this improvement will
                be the leveling and placement of the multipurpose terf sports field. Otherwise art
                fixtures and building materials will be made of primarily donated or local recycled
                materials and repurposed for the park fixtures. Social: Community backing for this
