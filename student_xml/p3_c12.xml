        <intro type="ltr_int">
            <p> Over the course of the past several years, there have been a large number of
                unfortunate situations involving police and their decision making throughout the
                United States. In some of the situations, the police made correct decisions in
                addressing a potentially violent situation. In other cases, there was blatant misuse
                of police power, which resulted in the death of innocent citizens. In many of these
                cases, it the end result is a 'he said, she said' situation. Witnesses of the event
                will tell what they saw and the police officer will give his account of the event as
                well. There is no way to tell which of these accounts is correct, and the benefit of
                the doubt has generally been given to the police officer versus the average citizen.
                There needs to be a definite way for the correct and accurate story to be told, and
                that can be done by requiring police body cameras for all members of the Scranton
                police force. <note type="peer">It could help make your proposal sound less bias
                    (and thus more persuasive to more people) if you make a statement about how this
                    is to benefit both the rights of the police officers and citizens. Otherwise,
                    very effective intro summary.</note></p>
        </intro>
        <background>
            <p>
                <crnt_cond> In the city of Scranton, there are currently no body cameras
                    implemented. The last public mention of adding body cameras to the police force
                    for the city of Scranton came in 2014 when an article was published in the Times
                    Tribune about the lack of budget for the cameras. </crnt_cond>
            </p>
            <p>
                <subj_hist> Due to a number of incidents in the past several years, more and more
                    departments are implementing body cameras with their squadrons. One of the most
                    progressive cities in recent times has been the city of Los Angeles. Just two
                    months ago in June, the city council unanimously approved an almost 70 million
                    dollar budget to have body cameras on 7,000 police officers by 2018. Since the
                    recent incidents in places like Ferguson and Baton Rouge, it is becoming more
                    and more necessary for footage of questionable police situations to be
                    available. This allows a correct representation of the incident without any
                    doubts. <note type="peer">It could be helpful to talk about relevant background
                        in Scranton for this section too. Not necessarily about camera's but maybe
                        they have had other issues with law enforcement that could have been avoided
                        by camera's in the past. Something to make the need for body camera's more
                        obvious to the reader (the Scranton Police Chief).</note>

                    body cameras on all active police officers.</scope>
                <objective>The proposed system of body cameras will include cameras for all active
                    police officers in the city. The system will provide assurance that correct
                    police procedures are being followed in all situations. It will ensure that all
                    police are operating with the public's safety in mind. </objective>

        </purpose>
        <approach>
            <p>
                <execution>The initial plan for the system is to roll it out in several phases. The
                    first phase will be a test run for 15 police officers. The usefulness of the
                    cameras will be evaluated in different situations including court trials and
                    performance reviews. If the trial goes well, the program can be expanded to
                    other officers in waves. The entire police force could be outfitted with cameras
                    in two years. Each camera's battery would last a full 24 hour day and record to
                    an SD card. The camera will be impossible to turn off and the SD card will be
                    removable at the end of each day with the video stored for a week. If any
                    complaints arises, the video of the certain event can be saved. <note

                        implement.</note></execution>
            </p>
        </approach>
        <feasibility>
            <p>
                <economic> The main issue that has come up across police forces regarding body
                    cameras has been the lack of budget space to purchase cameras. In order for the
                    Los Angeles Police Department to implement their body cameras, they acquired a
                    budget of $70 million. This will provide cameras for about 9,000 officers.
                    Scranton Police Department has around 200 officers, so the cost of the program
                    should only be around $1.5 million. Despite the large cost, this is an important
                    program that will provide a safer environment for everyone in the city.
                    President Obama has mentioned on several occasions the need for body cameras and
                    the possibility of federal funding being provided to equip officers with them.
                        <note type="peer">I like that you cite Obama's argument in this, it makes it
                        sound more interesting and relevant. However, it would be stronger if you
                        expanded on it a little bit and added a quote or something about why Obama
                        feels it is important.</note></economic>
                <!-- should insert some social feasibility about effects of 
                body cams on public-->
                <note type="peer">I agree you could use this as an opportunity to comment on the
                    social feasiblity. You obviously think that it will be a welcomed change in
                    Scranton from the general publics point of view, and it shouldn't have a major
                    negative impact on any officer's day to day. So this is probably very feasibile
                    as a social change.</note>
            </p>
        </feasibility>
        <conclu>
            <p> Although Scranton is not a huge city with large records of police violence, body
                cameras are a necessity for all police. They provide two main purposes. They can
                ensure that police are handling situations appropriately and they can act as
                evidence in court cases where a defendant may be questioning the police's handling
                of the situation. Overall, the safety that the cameras will provide should outweigh
                the drawback of allocating funds to purchase the cameras. Many of the larger cities
                such as New York City and Los Angeles are implementing programs and it would be a
                good idea to get on the right side of this situation and acquire body cameras as
                soon as the budget will allow the city to. <!-- Conclusion needs some work -->
                <note type="peer"> This conclusion is excellent and really gets your point across!
                    You don't really address all these points in the rest of your report
                    though.</note>

        <report type="peer" resp="#s23">
            <p>This particular proposal sounds a lot like a plea from the public for the city of
                Scranton to make changes in its law enforcement. Public initiative proposals are a
                means of communicating with government officials (or in this case police officials)
                the desires of the community, therefore yes, it makes sense to use this genre for
                the particular rhetorical situation. Language and word level choice are very
                appropriate for any adult reader, which is important for this genre since anyone
                could be reading it. However, I feel like you may be a little too factual for the
                genre. It is good to be professional and have irrefutable arguments in your proposal
                because that is what makes your proposal legitimate. In your background section I
                would recommend adding some personal notes about how body cameras could be of
                particular benefit to Scranton though since you’re trying to convince this
                particular department. Even if the purpose is for Scranton to take preventative
                measures and basically “get with the times” and follow the lead of other cities in
                the nation. You could also mention how it would instill a greater feeling of safety
                in the community and trust in police officers. Considering your audience is
                particularly important when you’re addressing your purpose as well. I think you
                might be thinking mostly about how body camera’s will affect the general public, but
                your audience is the police chief. I think you should refocus your purpose to also
                primarily state the benefit body cameras would serve to police officers in the
                “purpose” section. This would reposition your focus a little more strategically.
                Also, I like that you outline your scope very clearly, but I wonder if putting such
                a specific date on this proposal is hindering your argument. It might sound more
                persuasive and realistic if you give loose deadlines to support your plan to
                implement body cameras in phases. Instead you could say that these cameras will be
                implemented over a 2-3 year range so that there is flexibility in finding the funds
                for this. Despite your concerns, I think you use the schema very well and have a
                really strong conclusion. I wouldn’t recommend changing anything in your conclusion
                and instead adjust your background and purpose sections to reflect more on what is
                in your conclusion. You should absolutely mention that the safety benefits should
                outweigh the costs earlier in your proposal and talk about how it isn’t something
                that needs to be done immediately, but it is something that should be on the chief’s
                mind because it is important. You can also mention earlier that it would be
                beneficial for Scranton to follow to lead of cities like New York and LA because
                they have a successful model for what could be really important preventative
                measures in Scranton. </p>
