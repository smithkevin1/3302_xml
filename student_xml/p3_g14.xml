        <greeting>Hello,</greeting>
        <intro_para>
            <intent type="purpose">I am very interested applying for the Foundry Operations Co-op at
                Ginkgo BioWorks.</intent>
            <intent type="connection">Last year, I had spoken with representatives of the company at
                a Northeastern University Biotechnology career event, and had proceeded through to a
                phone interview with a member of the company thereafter, but was deferred due to
                lack of experience at the time (as it would have been my first co-op).</intent>
            <reason>I am still extremely interested in the type of work that Ginkgo is doing, and
                the doors it will unlock for further biotechnological innovation,</reason> and
                <proposition>I believe that an opportunity to work at Ginkgo in Spring 2017 would
                allow for me to both make a noticeable contribution to the team and work being done,
                as well as provide a unique and powerful learning and skill-development experience
                as I strive to further develop my competency in this field.</proposition>
        </intro_para>
        <para_background>
            <!-- One or More -->
            <experience type="school">Through my Bioengineering coursework, with a concentration in
                Cell and Tissue Engineering, I have gained an understanding of genetics, tissue
                mechanics, proteomics, and cellular engineering, and continue to pursue
                opportunities to learn more about the science and find creative ways to apply this
                knowledge.</experience>
            <experience type="personal">While on campus, I have volunteered my time in two research
                labs, <skills>developing and executing mechanical engineering experiments</skills>
                in the Bubble Imaging Lab and <skills>learning cell culture/passaging, transfection,
                    and biological assay techniques</skills> in the Addiction Sciences Lab, which I
                continue to be involved with. When not doing research, I serve as a mentor with
                multiple organizations on campus, further developing <skills>strong interpersonal
                    and leadership skills that enable my ability to lead groups and harness
                    initiative.</skills></experience>

        <para_background>
            <experience type="work">At my first co-op, I gained experience in a neurobiological
                research setting at Duke Universtiy, gaining proficiency with
                    <programs>MatLab</programs> and familiarity with <programs>python</programs> to
                    <accomplishments>develop an automated animal behavior training
                    paradigm</accomplishments> and <accomplishments>conduct comprehensive
                    analysis</accomplishments> of both behavioral and <skills>calcium
                    imaging</skills> experiments. Throughout this experience, I gained <skills>
                    skill and experience with both digesting and writing technical
                    documentation,</skills> as well as developed ways to <skills>abstract simple
                    meaning and explanation of technical concepts.</skills> At the end of my co-op,
                    <accomplishments>I gave an hour-long comprehensive presentation of my work with
                    both animal behavior and calcium imaging to the entire lab in a lab
                    meeting.</accomplishments></experience>

        <closing_statements>
            <compatability>I believe that my relevant experience, extreme interest in the work being
                done/potential applications of the technological paradigm being developed at Ginkgo,
                and personal qualities would make this a great fit.</compatability>
            <pb/>
            <next_step>I eagerly await your call at 1-800-666-5555 so that we can discuss possible
                next steps and answer questions about moving forward.</next_step>
