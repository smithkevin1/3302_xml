            <p>From reading the cover letter, the writer wants to apply a game programming job in
                Filament Games. The cover letter shows that the writer had met most of the
                requirement and would fit well for the job position. The rhetorical situation is
                appropriate for the cover letter and the whole cover letter looks well organized and
                clear. I think the writer did well in demonstrate the school, work and personal
                experience in the background paragraph. After reading the job description, I can see
                that the writer really fits the position well. The word-level is pretty good since
                the person who will read the cover letter is an expert of all those computer
                engineering works. The question from her self-review about the <proposition/>, I
                think it fits the element meaning, I used the element in the same way. I don’t think
                the writer needs to add anything to the background but I think she can add something
                to make the reader feel that she really wants the job and did the research on the
                company at the beginning of the cover letter or at the end of it. Also, the writer
                can add some other skills such as communication skills which can show she would be a
                good in team working. Other than the content in the cover letter, I think some of
                the schema are not used. Most of the schema uses fine but I think it would be more
                clearly if the writer can put the background paragraph “in pieces” by schema, such
                as <programs/>
                <skills/>

            <p>Check out my in-line comments--there is a lot going well here, especially in that
                second background paragraph. You do need to pay careful attention to minor issues (a
                few of which I pointed out above), especially in a document of this length.</p>
