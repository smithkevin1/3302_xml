                and 3D modeling. My personal projects highlighting these principles and topics can

                Novartis Pharmaceuticals and ChoiceStream, where I collaborated with developers,
                designers, managers, and other professionals in various fields to create internal
                web applications. At these companies, I applied universal standards of debugging,
                testing, automation, documentation, and version control. These opportunities taught
                me to follow a fast schedule of daily stand-ups and weekly sprints and appreciate
                flexible, collective design.</experience>
