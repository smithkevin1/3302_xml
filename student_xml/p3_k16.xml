        <greeting>Dear Mr. O'Brein: </greeting>
        <intro_para>
            <intent type="purpose">I’m writing to apply for the Software Engineering Co-p role over
                at at Smartleaf. </intent>
            <reason>Currently I'm going into my last coop here at Norteastern, and with my previous
                two coops I've worked at an extremely small company of about four people and a much
                larger company of more than 30,000 people, and I'd like to gain experience with
                working at a company the size of Smartleaf.</reason>
            <proposition> I believe that my experience as a Computer Science student working in more
                finance oriented positions would make me a perfect candidate for this position.
            </proposition>
        </intro_para>

        <para_background>
            <experience type="school"> Currently, I'm a Computer Science student here at
                Northeastern University. I beleive that my experiences with going through my classes
                and projects has helped me build skills to excel in industry. However, one of the
                main advantages of going to Northeastern was being able to gain experience through
                different coops. </experience>
        </para_background>
        <para_background>
            <experience type="work">My first coop was working at Mavenomics, a small company in
                Cambridge. I created and implemented tools for data analysis into their main product
                and used languages such as <programs>python and JavaScript</programs>, and
                frameworks such as <programs>d3.js and React.</programs> Due to the small nature of
                the company, I gained exposure to every other part of the company, and I gained an
                overarching view about how businesses are run. </experience>
        </para_background>
        <para_background>
            <experience type="work"> My next coop was working for Goldman Sachs in New York, a much
                larger company than my previous coop. During my time there, I learned more about
                applications of Computer Science in the field of finance. On top of that, I gained
                experience with working in a team oriented environment, were multiple teams come
                together to build a product.</experience>
        </para_background>
        <para_closing>
            <compatability>I believe that I have the experience and skill set to excel in this
                position , and I feel like the medium sized company environment would be a great fit
                for me.</compatability>
            <next_step> I'm excited to hear back from you, and would appriciate the opportunity to
                meet and talk in person. </next_step>
            <acknowledgment>Thank you for your consideration. </acknowledgment>

        <!-- Writer' Memo -->
        <!-- Where are you in the process?
        Currently I have a rough draft of a cover letter
        
        2. What is your rhetorical situation?
        I’m writing a cover letter for a coop position I found on NEUCool. The company is a place called Smartleaf, and it builds computer algorithms automate wealth management.
        
        3. What is going well?
        Overall, I feel like writing a cover letter is a fairly straight forward, and I think I managed to follow the schema and put together a decent cover letter.
        
        4. What has been difficult?
        Reading over my cover letter, I feel like it seems a little bit scattered. I think I should add more about why I would be a good fit. -->
