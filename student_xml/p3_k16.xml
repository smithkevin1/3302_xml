            <intent type="purpose">I’m writing to apply for the Software Engineering Co-p role over
                at at <!-- Repeated word -->Smartleaf. </intent>
            <reason>Currently I'm going into my last coop here at Norteastern, and with my previous
                two coops I've worked at an extremely small company of about four people and a much
                larger company of more than 30,000 people, and I'd like to gain experience with
                working at a company the size of
                Smartleaf.<!-- Long sentence - break up for conciseness + clarity --></reason>
            <proposition> I believe that my experience as a Computer Science student working in more
                finance oriented positions would make me a perfect candidate for this position.

            <experience type="school"> Currently, I'm a Computer Science student here at
                Northeastern University. I beleive that my experiences with going through my classes
                and projects has helped me build skills to excel in industry. However, one of the
                main advantages of going to Northeastern was being able to gain experience through
                different coops. </experience>

            <experience type="work">My first coop was working at Mavenomics, a small company in
                Cambridge. I created and implemented tools for data analysis into their main product
                and used languages such as <programs>python and JavaScript</programs>, and
                frameworks such as <programs>d3.js and React.</programs> Due to the small nature of
                the company, I gained exposure to every other part of the company, and I gained an
                overarching view about how businesses are run. </experience>

            <experience type="work"> My next coop was working for Goldman Sachs in New York, a much
                larger company than my previous coop. During my time there, I learned more about
                applications of Computer Science in the field of finance. On top of that, I gained
                experience with working in a team oriented environment, were multiple teams come
                together to build a product.</experience>

        <!-- Writer' Memo -->
        <!-- Where are you in the process?
        Currently I have a rough draft of a cover letter
        
        2. What is your rhetorical situation?
        I’m writing a cover letter for a coop position I found on NEUCool. The company is a place called Smartleaf, and it builds computer algorithms automate wealth management.
        
        3. What is going well?
        Overall, I feel like writing a cover letter is a fairly straight forward, and I think I managed to follow the schema and put together a decent cover letter.
        
        4. What has been difficult?
        Reading over my cover letter, I feel like it seems a little bit scattered. I think I should add more about why I would be a good fit. -->

        <report type="peer" resp="#m19">
            <p>For Project 3, Gurtaj wrote a cover letter. A cover letter would be included with a
                resume as a response to a job opening. Overall, Gurtaj's writing follows this genre;
                it is broken up into introduction, experience, and closing sections. The bulk of the
                writing deals with his experience, which is appropriate for a cover letter. The
                sentences and tone are professional, which is important because he is addressing a
                hiring manager who has the power to continue or stop the job application process.
                The word choices are mostly appropriate, and they detail his technical experience with
                different software components. However, I think that the contractions should be left
                out of professional writing. I also think that the experience sections could be developed
                with more details of the work and projects Gurtaj has done.</p>
            <p>I think that Gurtaj has followed the basic schema of a cover letter well. However,
                the experience sections could use more information. He mentions in his school
                experience section that his classes and projects helped him build skills, but he
                does not explain what the classes and projects were and the skills he got from them.
                In the paragraph about Mavenomics, he could detail what specific projects he worked
                on. In the Goldman Sachs paragraph, he could explain the work he did when he
                "learned about applications of Computer Science in the field of finance." I think
                that this paragraph is especially important considering that he wants to work in
                finance-oriented positions. While it is good to know and address the desired work
                environment, I think that the size of companies is over-emphasized. I think that the
                main focus should be on the work that Smartleaf does, and everything should tie to
                that and the desire to get more experience in finance-type positions.</p>
