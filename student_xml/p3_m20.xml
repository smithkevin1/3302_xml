        <greeting>Hello Mr.Morrissey,</greeting>
        <intro_para>
            <intent type="purpose">I am interested in the Software Engineering job at EMC
                Corporation.</intent>
            <intent type="connection"/> I became interested in the job, after searching the job
            position on NEU COOL. Although my major is information science, I took all the computer
            science classes in college and I meet the requirments of the computer knowledge for this
                job.<reason>I have enjoyed my past work at EMC in the position of ADS testing in
                Hopkinton, </reason> and <proposition>I think I will fit well with EMC's culture and
                bring all the necessary abilities to go above and beyond my job
                requirements.</proposition>
        </intro_para>
        <para_background>
            <experience type="work">I bring previous experience with <programs>Iron
                    Python</programs> from my work at EMC in spring 2016 for my second co-op. As I
                mentioned before, I worked at Advanced Design Services group and I coded in
                    <programs>Iron Python</programs> to <accomplishments>test the newest servers and
                    equipments.</accomplishments> Our group, ADS, is a sub-team in DFx which stands
                for Design For X and my boss Dick Miller is the manager of the team. In this co-op,
                I had <accomplishments>developed a loop testing in Cumulus platform and it had been
                    used by ADS to Qual Testware and will be used for Debug. </accomplishments>I
                also earned a <certifications>Bronze Award</certifications> for this.
                    <accomplishments>In processing of developing the test sequence, I took the
                    initiative to contact and work with the Cumulus Software Dev team in Shanghai to
                    compelete it. </accomplishments> Besides the developing of the loop sequence,
                    <accomplishments>I also developed the test for POST analyzer for
                    Infinity/Arcus.</accomplishments> In the last month of my co-op, my role was
                changed from a software developer to a SQA. <accomplishments>I did the SQA job to release the
                    tests for Infinity/Arcus by running tests on all the Warthogs and fixing the
                    software or potential hardware problems with the team. </accomplishments>
                <accomplishments>I worked hard and communicated with dev groups from Shanghai, Cork
                    and Franklin. Since all work is not done by one person, it's important to have
                    the team work ability to accomplish the work.</accomplishments> Besides the
                work, I attended the derating class and the IPMI class while I was working at EMC. I
                also attended the 3D printing workshop which was held in UMASS Lowell. I really
                enjoyed working at EMC because the EMC community has many events for employees from
                different cultures. There were Ping Pong competitions and lion dance during the
                Chinese New Year in February. These events help me put myself as a part of the EMC
                community. </experience>

        <para_background><experience type="work">I had my first co-op in Harvard School of Public
                Health in spring 2015 in IT services. In this co-op, I <accomplishments>developed
                    strong customer service skills by troubleshooting users’ software and hardware
                    problems. I communicated with customers by emails, phones and in-person. Because
                    most of my customers are not experts in computer, I need to explain the reason
                    of causing the problem and the way to prevent it. </accomplishments> I also
                    <accomplishments>collaborated with team to manage helpdesk responsibilities and
                    customer issues</accomplishments>. These experience helped me gain communication
                skills by facing different people.</experience>
            <experience type="school">Aside from my work experience, I learned
                    <programs>C++</programs>, <programs>Java</programs>, <programs>C</programs>, and
                    <programs>XML</programs> from my courses at Northeastern University which is a
                perfect fit for this job as a software engineer.</experience></para_background>


        <closing_statements>
            <compatability>Because of the previous work at EMC and my computer science knowledge, I
                think I will fit in well with the culture of EMC Corporation and this job position. </compatability>
            <next_step>I hope you will call me at 857-222-0943 so that we can discuss the next step
                in the hiring process. I look forward to working for this company again. Thank you
                very much for your consideration!</next_step>

        <report type="peer" resp="h15">
            <p>Chi’s genre is a cover letter for a Software Engineering position at EMC, a company
                for which she previously worked as an ADS tester. The object of the piece is to
                emphasize her interests and abilities relating to the job and to get an interview or
                get to the next steps of the hiring process. </p>
            <p> Chi does a good job in bringing in her previous experience from her co-ops,
                especially her previous EMC position. Potentially, she should go more in depth with
                her previous position at EMC and emphasize that she has already been a part of the
                community and flourished. Adding something like, “I look forward to working for this
                company again” will grab their attention and reiterate her involvement.
                Additionally, it would be good if she mentions her nontechnical abilities, such as
                working in a team and meeting stressful deadlines since those are important
                qualities in a candidate. I also recommend explaining any personal projects that
                relates to the skills needed for the position to show that she has a passion for
                that type of work. If not, then she can list some of her main technical interests or
                focus areas that tie in. Other than that, rewording some sentences and fixing some
                grammar would help the flow of the piece (I put some recommendations in). </p>
            <p> Overall, cover letters accompany resumes, so I think she should focus on emphasizing
                what isn’t included on her resume – that is strong personal traits and technical
                interests. Lastly, cover letters let candidates go more in depth in projects to show
                the company that they have a strong understanding in their studies, so that would
                also be good to look into. </p>
