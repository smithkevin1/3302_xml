            <p>Chi’s genre is a cover letter for a Software Engineering position at EMC, a company
                for which she previously worked as an ADS tester. The object of the piece is to
                emphasize her interests and abilities relating to the job and to get an interview or
                get to the next steps of the hiring process. </p>
            <p> Chi does a good job in bringing in her previous experience from her co-ops,
                especially her previous EMC position. Potentially, she should go more in depth with
                her previous position at EMC and emphasize that she has already been a part of the
                community and flourished. Adding something like, “I look forward to working for this
                company again” will grab their attention and reiterate her involvement.
                Additionally, it would be good if she mentions her nontechnical abilities, such as
                working in a team and meeting stressful deadlines since those are important
                qualities in a candidate. I also recommend explaining any personal projects that
                relates to the skills needed for the position to show that she has a passion for
                that type of work. If not, then she can list some of her main technical interests or
                focus areas that tie in. Other than that, rewording some sentences and fixing some
                grammar would help the flow of the piece (I put some recommendations in). </p>
            <p> Overall, cover letters accompany resumes, so I think she should focus on emphasizing
                what isn’t included on her resume – that is strong personal traits and technical
                interests. Lastly, cover letters let candidates go more in depth in projects to show
                the company that they have a strong understanding in their studies, so that would
                also be good to look into. </p>
