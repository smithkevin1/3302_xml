                <p>Boston is a city well known for its traffic congestion and bad drivers. 
                    In an effort to beat the congestion and go green, many people have turned
                    to biking as an alternative method of transportation in the city. While 
                    Boston has become increasingly bike friendly over the years, there are 
                    still many problem areas, the two most prominent being Commonwealth Avenue 
                    and Massachusetts Avenue. These two roadways account for largest contributions 
                    to bike accident numbers in the city. Although Commonwealth Ave. has a higher
                    total number of accidents, Mass Ave. has the most potential to increase the
                    safety of bike travel through upgrades to the roadway. </p>
            </intro>

                        From the Huntington Ave. intersection to the Charles River Bridge is the 
                        most problematic section of Mass Ave. This stretch of road is characterized
                        by poor road conditions, dark areas, and random sharrows, or shared bike/car lanes.

                    <subj_hist>
                        The vast majority of Boston bike infrastructure has been installed very recently, 
                        with most improvements taking place within the last decade. Since 2008, over 90 miles 
                        of bike lanes and markings have been put in place. An additional 3600 public bike 
                        parking spots have also been installed in the same time frame ("Infrastructure and
                        Network Overview"). It is clear that the city is still undergoing the process of 
                        becoming bike friendly and the improvements to Mass Ave. would be the next logical 
                        step in this process.

                        must give funding to the Massachusetts Department of Transportation (MassDOT); the agency 
                        in charge of upgrades to roadways and transportation safety.

                        by the construction bidding process. At current processing rates, it would take approximately a year
                        before any phyiscal work was done. Once started, it should take approximately one month or less
                        to complete the project in its entirety. If persued immediately, the project could be finished by
                        fall of 2017.

                    <objective>The proposed project would include repaving most sections of Mass Ave, 
                        followed by creating clear markings for the bike lanes. It would also include reclaiming 
                        the areas around the Huntington Ave. and Boylston St. intersections, where mismanaged 
                        construction has left concrete barriers indefinitely blocking the bike lanes. Lastly, 
                        there would be lighting upgrades along the stretch from Newbury St. to the Charles River Bridge,
                        where

                <p>
                    <action>To implement the changes, the first step that must be taken is having the MassDOT 
                    hire out a private construction company to take on the upgrades. From there, a plan
                    must be created to carry out the construction process with minimal disruption to 
                    daily traffic flows. Ideally, the ripping, paving, and repainting process could be
                    completed along the 1.2-mile stretch within 2 weeks of night work. Since the 
                    installation/upgrade of streetlights on the sidewalks is a more intensive but much 
                    less disruptive process, it could take closer to a full month to complete.   <!--text here-->

            </approach>
            
            <feasibility>  <!--attribute options: economic, social, environmental-->
                <p><economic>The two main obstacles in the process are costs and disruptions to traffic flow. 
                    The latter problem could be best mostly resolved by limiting work to night shifts
                    and if necessary, weekends. This would eliminate most lost revenues from employees being late
                    or storefronts being inaccessible. Furhtermore, since the department of transportation already 
                    has allotted budgets for roadwork and improvements, the funding problem is mostly a matter of 
                    securing those funds through petitions and demonstrations as to why the Mass Ave. upgrade is a 
                    pertinent problem. Several years ago the state approved Chapter 90, which allocated $200 million 
                    towards road repeairs. The US DOT average for repaving a 4-lane, 1 mile stretch of road is $502,000 
                    ("Paving Cost / Mile"). For the 1.2 mile stretch of repaving + light fixtures, the project would 
                    likely cost around $1.5 million. Given the funds available and the relevance of Mass Ave. to 
                    transportation, the listed improvements are highly feasible from a financial standpoint.</economic>
                </p>
                <p><environmental>
                    Since the entire stretch of road already exists, no clearing of any greenspace or natural elements would
                    be required. As a result, the construction process would have no environmental impacts on the road or 
                    surrounding areas.                                
                </environmental></p>

            <conclu>
                <p>
                    Performing these upgrades will increase both the usability and safety of bike travel along a 
                    major city road. Indirect affects of the construction would be an increase in bike 
                    users and decrease in traffic congestion. Overall, the changes will lead to improved transportation 
                    in the city of Boston.

                Chris' public proposal is on the issue of bike safety on the major
                Mass Ave. and Comm Ave. The proposal is allocate funds to repave and
                repaint bike lanes in order to make them safer on these roads.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'll first address the 2 areas to focus on in the paper. When looking at the
                scope "who", I took that as literally who this is going to effect. So in
                your case I think that would be MassDOT and the government in general
                because they'll have to foot the bill. The approach meanwhile, 
                should outline how your proposal will be implemented. For example, how the lanes will
                be paved over what course of time. The second area was the strength of the
                feasibility section. In this section, you should show how its possible
                for the task to be done. I would split it up into 2 or 3 sections.
                First section could be economic, explain how much it would cost
                and how the funds could get allocated towards the task. The second could
                be environmental and show that it would not have any major environmental
                impact.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some general schema comments: approach and feasibility should not have
                type attributes. Approach should have an execution or action element
                contained within a paragraph <!-- <approach> <p> <execution> Text here </execution> </p> </approach> --> element. Feasibility
                should have economic, social, or environmental elements within a paragraph
                element as well. I would include some references to back up points that
                you are trying to make. Maybe include an article about the number of
                bike crashes on those roads to add credibility to your comments. I 
                think your objective element under purpose could be taken out and just
                added to your approach element. The objective element should show why
                the project should show the actual purpose. I.e. that it would make biking safer,
                encourage more people to bike, and save fossil fuels. Overall its a well
                formed idea, just deciding what information to put in what section is tough
                given that the schema is very broadly defined.
