        <page type="exec_sum">From Arduino to Raspberry Pi, development of affordable SOCs has been
            the jet-fuel of the 21st century hobbyist revolution. The removal of barriers relating
            to cost and complexity is causing a largely unregulated proliferation of drone
            development. As a result, an exponential number of drones are taking to the skies each
            year, outpacing the FAA and local authorities' ability to regulate them. Compounding the
            difficulty of impeding aerial objects with the ability of pilots to navigate their
            drones from remote locations exposes a serious vulnerability with maintaining privacy,
            safety and security. <pb/>Preempting a dramatic increase in laws regulating drone usage,
            our goal is to develop an anti-drone system that can autonomously track and capture a
            target in a way that is safe to the drone and the public.</page>
        <page type="pre_req_ana">
            <app_ovr type="obj" title="Tracking">The anti-drone will be able to takeoff from a given
                location while being operated by a pilot. Once the target is in frame and
                recognized, the drone should be capable of autonomously moving above of the target. </app_ovr>
            <app_ovr type="obj" title="Target Acquisition">Once the anti-drone is in position,
                electromagnets will be deployed to neutralize the target. At this point the pilot
                can resume control and navigate the anti-drone to a position in which the disabled
                drone can be dropped. </app_ovr>
            <app_ovr type="rls" title="Regulations">The FAA has regularly been advancing their
                regulations on drone usage. The most up to date rules can be found at:
                    <ref>https://www.faa.gov/uas/media/Part_107_Summary.pdf</ref>. Relevant to our
                project are the weight constraints (55lb), licensing requirements and flight
                regulations (Cannot be operated indoors, drone must be visible from pilot's location
                and drone cannot fly over individuals not involved in its development). </app_ovr>

        <page type="fsb">
            <fsb_hlgt type="econ">This project has been allotted a budget of $1,000. Although it is
                possible to appeal for additional funding, there do not exist products on the market
                that could directly address our goals even with ample funding. It is worth noting
                that many equal and more advanced DIY projects have achieved success on smaller
                budgets. </fsb_hlgt>
            <fsb_hlgt type="tcnl">The project can be broken down into four stages. 1) Determine
                necessary equipment to assemble a quad-copter drone and camera configuration. 2)
                Enable long range object tracking for stationary targets. 3) Develop and attach the
                magnet capturing system. 4) Accommodate short range object tracking and automated
                capturing for stationary targets. 5) Develop tracking and capture of moving targets.
                <pb/>1) In order to allow for ample time to tackle the advances in research put
                forth by our project, it is vital to minimize the amount of time dedicated to drone
                construction. As a result a quad-copter style frame makes more sense than investing
                in the more difficult to control (although more steady) hex or octo-copter designs.
                By using a frame kit, time will be saved by not having to build and tune one from
                scratch, and being able to modify it provides obvious benefits that buying a
                stock-copter does not. Similarly, the choice of the Pixy CMUcam5 for camera allows
                all object detection to be automated. This not only frees up the time of the
                software developers, allowing them to focus on other goals, but it also justifies
                the use of the Raspberry Pi 3b -- which has a less complex set of barriers than its
                more powerful SOC counterparts. <pb/>2) The data being fed from the Pixy should
                allow for object identification and location. Determining motor commands in order to
                move toward an identified object is straightforward in a low-variable environment,
                however the movement of our anti-drone and the frame size of the Pixy (risking the
                visual loss of the target) pose significant issues. This will likely need to be
                accommodated by slow movements and an adjustable camera. <pb/>3) The chief concerns
                for the magnetic system is the weight that it would add to the drone and issues that
                EMI might cause. A Faraday cage might be a working alternative, however testing will
                need to be performed to determine the possibility of this option. <pb/>4) In order
                to descend upon the target, it is very likely that a second camera will need to be
                added facing downward. The issues with kinematics in this step are that movement
                must be much more fine in order to ensure visual of the target drone is not lost.
                Additionally the acquisition of the target must be performed in a way that does not
                damage the anti-drone, and does not cause an irreconcilable weight increase. <pb/>5)
                The processes described above are made significantly more challenging when both
                objects are moving. It is realistic that this would be a project in
                itself.</fsb_hlgt>
            <fsb_hlgt type="suits">Acquiring a license and executing the above processes should be
                of no great impediment. </fsb_hlgt>
