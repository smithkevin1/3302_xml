        <page type="exec_sum">From Arduino to Raspberry Pi, development of affordable SOCs has been
            the jet-fuel of the 21st century hobbyist revolution. The removal of barriers relating
            to cost and complexity is causing a largely unregulated proliferation of drone
            development. As a result, an exponential number of drones are taking to the skies each
            year, outpacing the FAA and local authorities' ability to regulate them. Compounding the
            difficulty of impeding aerial objects with the ability of pilots to navigate their
            drones from remote locations exposes a serious vulnerability with maintaining privacy,
            safety and security. <pb/>Preempting a dramatic increase in laws regulating drone usage,
            our goal is to develop an anti-drone system that can autonomously track and capture a
            target in a way that is safe to the drone and the public.</page>
        <page type="pre_req_ana">
            <app_ovr type="obj" title="Tracking">The anti-drone will be able to takeoff from a given
                location while being operated by a pilot. Once the target is in frame and
                recognized, the drone should be capable of autonomously moving above of the target. </app_ovr>
            <app_ovr type="obj" title="Target Acquisition">Once the anti-drone is in position,
                electromagnets will be deployed to neutralize the target. At this point the pilot
                can resume control and navigate the anti-drone to a position in which the disabled
                drone can be dropped. </app_ovr>
            <app_ovr type="rls" title="Regulations">The FAA has regularly been advancing their
                regulations on drone usage. The most up to date rules can be found at:
                    <ref>https://www.faa.gov/uas/media/Part_107_Summary.pdf</ref>. Relevant to our
                project are the weight constraints (55lb), licensing requirements and flight
                regulations (Cannot be operated indoors, drone must be visible from pilot's location
                and drone cannot fly over individuals not involved in its development). </app_ovr>

            <fsb_hlgt type="econ">This project has been allotted a budget of $1,000. 
                <note type="peer">Glad you included budget, it puts alot of the project in perspective</note> Although it is
                possible to appeal for additional funding, there do not exist products on the market
                that could directly address our goals even with ample funding. It is worth noting
                that many equal and more advanced DIY projects have achieved success on smaller
                budgets. </fsb_hlgt>
            <fsb_hlgt type="tcnl">The project can be broken down into four stages. 1) Determine
                necessary equipment to assemble a quad-copter drone and camera configuration. 2)
                Enable long range object tracking for stationary targets. 3) Develop and attach the
                magnet capturing system. 4) Accommodate short range object tracking and automated
                capturing for stationary targets. 5) Develop tracking and capture of moving targets.
                <pb/>1) In order to allow for ample time to tackle the advances in research put
                forth by our project, it is vital to minimize the amount of time dedicated to drone
                construction. As a result a quad-copter style frame makes more sense than investing
                in the more difficult to control (although more steady) hex or octo-copter designs.
                By using a frame kit, time will be saved by not having to build and tune one from
                scratch, and being able to modify it provides obvious benefits that buying a
                stock-copter does not. Similarly, the choice of the Pixy CMUcam5 for camera allows
                all object detection to be automated. This not only frees up the time of the
                software developers, allowing them to focus on other goals, but it also justifies
                the use of the Raspberry Pi 3b -- which has a less complex set of barriers than its
                more powerful SOC counterparts. <pb/>2) The data being fed from the Pixy should
                allow for object identification and location. Determining motor commands in order to
                move toward an identified object is straightforward in a low-variable environment,
                however the movement of our anti-drone and the frame size of the Pixy (risking the
                visual loss of the target) pose significant issues. This will likely need to be
                accommodated by slow movements and an adjustable camera. <pb/>3) The chief concerns
                for the magnetic system is the weight that it would add to the drone and issues that
                EMI might cause. A Faraday cage might be a working alternative, however testing will
                need to be performed to determine the possibility of this option. <pb/>4) In order
                to descend upon the target, it is very likely that a second camera will need to be
                added facing downward. The issues with kinematics in this step are that movement
                must be much more fine in order to ensure visual of the target drone is not lost.
                Additionally the acquisition of the target must be performed in a way that does not
                damage the anti-drone, and does not cause an irreconcilable weight increase. <pb/>5)
                The processes described above are made significantly more challenging when both
                objects are moving. It is realistic that this would be a project in
                itself.</fsb_hlgt>
            <fsb_hlgt type="suits">Acquiring a license and executing the above processes should be
                of no great impediment. </fsb_hlgt>

                    world, a time requirement should be instantiated such that the drone could react
                    quickly to a threat, however as this report details a research project, there is

            <req_sect>Drone Acquisition <req>The anti-drone should be able to make contact with at
                    least a 10lb target drone. Theoretically it should be able to disable the target
                    drone, however there is no way of guaranteeing that the magnets will be capable
                    of this in all circumstances. After acquisition, the drone should be able to fly
                    at least 100 yards with the target drone in tow before releasing it.

            <fsb>In order to accomplish the mission put forth by our capstone design, not only does
                our project require well executed engineering, but it will also contain an aspect of
                research. The engineering portion is represented by the leveraging of existing
                tools, and the research portion is represented in our tracking and capture
                technology. Due to the uncertainty of research, not only is it impossible to
                accurately predict the development process, but it also obfuscates what is
                realistic.</fsb>
            <cond>The primary point of difficulty will be the limited time we have to develop our
                product. There is no doubt that what we seek to do is possible, however budgeting
                time is of the greatest order of importance. Minimizing time spent on "reinventing
                the wheel" will allow us to focus on the unique aspects of our project, however even
                then it still seems doubtful that the project will be functioning at peak
                performance come December. </cond>
            <sum>It is reasonable to expect the tracking capabilities of two moving objects can be
                completed by December, however the team will need to reevaluate at a later and better informed date if time allows for
                the capturing capabilities to be integrated.</sum>

        <report type="peer" resp="#b11">
            <p>Oliver is writing a feasibility study for developing an anti-drone system
            in order to combat the speedy rise of commercial drones because of the percieved
            risks to safety and security, and also the slowness of regulation to adapt to technology.
            </p>
            <p>So firstly, I have to hand it to the author and say that this is a really cool idea. His 
            preliminary document mentioned that he has worked with this as part of his capstone, and I think
            it lends itself really well to the genre of the Feasibility Study. He mentioned that he wanted to 
            avoid being redundant in the document, I definitely understand that because it is easy to do so here.
            Oliver does a really good job avoiding this and it makes the document fun to read, which feasibility studies are often not. 
            I noted a few things I thought were discrepancies in the table of contents, but otherwise the present content matches 
            the genre very well, at least from my understanding of it. </p>
            
            <p> That being said I think this specific feasibility study would benefit greatly from a risk analysis chart and
            an image/design of the proposed system. I think detailing what you believe the final result
            may look like, even if you don't have the full picture yet, would help support the "pick-up and read"
            idea of feasibility studies. It would support the simplicity of the document, and as you know
            everyone loves pictures. </p>
            
            <p> Oliver asked for a critique of his use of "pre_req_ana and succ_crit", but I think they
            are being used very appropriately. I think he avoids being redundant where it is very easy to do
            and successfully separated the paradigm of thinking between the two. The "What will we have to do" vs
            "what will make / break this project" My one thought might be to include more regulatory thoughts
            relating to the permitting of the anti-drone device and how you might run into legal trouble, but that could also
            be included in a risk analysis table. </p>
