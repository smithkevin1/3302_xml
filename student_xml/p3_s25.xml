            <section_header>How do bacteria move?</section_header>
            <question>How is it that bacteria travel from one place to another?</question>
            <misconception>You may think the answer is trivial, since moving is a problem solved by
                nature time and time again. However, to truly understand the mechanisms for travel
                and why they are the way they are requires an understanding about the world of
                bacteria, specifically the world they live in.</misconception>
            <technical_principle>The first step is to understand the <important_idea>Reynolds
                    number.</important_idea>
            </technical_principle>

            <section_header>What is the Reynolds number?</section_header>
            <technical_principle n="1">Mathematically, the Reynolds number can be expressed like
                this: <visual type="other"
                    url="http://ffden-2.phys.uaf.edu/104_2012_web_projects/Daniela_Wilner/Images/ReynoldsNumber.png"
                /> The Reynolds number (Re in the equation above) is defined as the ratio of
                inertial forces to viscous forces. What does that mean? Well the first thing that
                should be noted is that it is a ratio. It has no units attached. The Reynolds number
                can be 46, it can 46 million. It’s just a number. But it is a very useful number,
                especially for engineers. Engineers use the Reynolds number to characterize how a
                fluid (liquid or gas) flows. It tells engineers when to use certain equations for
                certain situations, and when not to use them. </technical_principle>
            <section_header>What does the Reynolds number depend on?</section_header>
            <technical_principle n="2">Here’s the breakdown: ρ is density of the fluid, V is
                velocity, D is diameter, or the size of the volume being analyzed, and μ is
                viscosity, which is a fluid's resistance to movement <analogy>(molasses is much more
                    viscous than water).</analogy>
            </technical_principle>
            <section_header>So what is low for a Reynolds number?</section_header>
            <analogy>Let's take a person swimming in water. Let's call him Arnold. <visual
                    type="drawing"
                    url="http://www.how-to-draw-funny-cartoons.com/image-files/cartoon-swimmer-007.jpg"
                />Arnold swims at an average speed of 2 mph or .894 m/s in water which has a density
                of 1000 kg/m^3 and a viscosity of about 10^-3 Pa*s. We can approximate Arnold's
                size, or diameter, as 1.5 ft or .457 m. Put these numbers into the equation and we
                get a Reynolds number of about 409000. Now, lets take a look at an E. coli cell.
                    <visual type="drawing"
                    url="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/biology/imgbio/cellprokaryote6.gif"
                />A typical cell might be 2 μm or 2*10^-6 m and travel in water at a speed of 30
                μm/s or 3*10^-7 m/s. In this case your Reynolds number would be 0.00006 . That's
                several magnitudes smaller than Arnold's situation. If Arnold wanted to experience
                the same Reynold's number as an E. coli cell he would have to move at a speed of
                about 1.3*10^-10 m/s. If he were to move at that speed for a whole year he would
                travel a staggering 4 millimeters.</analogy>
            <section_header>What does this tell us?</section_header>
            <important_idea>It tells us fluid flow has different properties at this level. It tells
                us life is different at low Reynolds numbers. </important_idea><technical_principle
                n="3">To understand this further we have to go back to the definition of Reynolds
                number: the ratio of inertial forces to viscous forces. The lower your Reynolds
                number, the lower your inertia is compared to the viscous forces of the fluid around
                you.</technical_principle>
            <analogy>What does this mean? Imagine you get in the water and push Arnold. He will move
                while he’s being pushed, and then inertia will carry him so he floats a little bit
                farther away from you. Do the same in molasses, and he’ll stop almost immediately
                once the force of your push stops acting on him. <technical_principle n="4">His
                    movement in the water only depends on a current force acting on him, not on the
                    forces acting on him before. In this case, his movement is not dependent on
                    time. It is said to be <important_idea>time invariant.</important_idea>
                </technical_principle>
            </analogy>
            <section_header>Scallop Theorem </section_header>
            <specific_topic>This concept is the cornerstone of Scallop Theorem, a theorem developed
                by physicist Edward Mills Purcell in his paper &quot;Life at low Reynolds
                number.&quot;</specific_topic><technical_principle n="5">”. It states that to travel
                at low Reynolds number a swimmer has to move or deform in a way that is not
                reciprocal. </technical_principle>
            <analogy>. A great example of this is, of course, the scallop. A scallop travels in
                water by slowly opening its shell to take in water, and quickly squirting it out to
                propel itself. <visual type="drawing"
                    url="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/40/Scallop_jump.svg"
                    /><technical_principle n="6">While this works great in a scallop’s environment,
                    it would be useless at low Reynolds numbers, due to the fact that the movement
                    is reciprocal. Since motion at low Reynolds flow is time invariant, the fact
                    that the scallop opened and closed its shell slowly and quickly does not matter.
                    In this case, the scallop would simply move one way when the shell opens, and
                    move right back to the same spot when it closes.
                </technical_principle></analogy>
            <section_header>So how do you move?</section_header>
            <explanation>Due to these constraints, bacteria have developed interesting ways to move
                around. The most common of these methods is the use of flagella, which are whip-like
                appendages connected to the main cell body by a hook.<visual type="drawing"
                    url="http://i.imgur.com/hDHJp6l.jpg"/> The hook is connected to a biological
                motor, which spins the flagella. The spinning of these typically helical flagella
                works since it is not reciprocal; it is different when done in forward or in
                reverse. <visual type="drawing" url="http://i.imgur.com/l2bQzNs.png"/> The use of
                flagella is fairly common in the world of bacteria. E coli. use flagella. <visual

                /> So does Helicobacter pylori, a bacterium found in the stomach. <visual

                    url="http://userfiles.steadyhealth.com/userfiles/4540/articles/H.pylori.gif"/>
                Other bacteria such as the Spirochaete have a spiral shape and move by whole-body
                undulations. Their spiral shape allow their movement to be non-reciprocal. <visual

            <section_header>Conclusion</section_header>
            <conclusion>Given their microscopic size, it's quite fascinating to see such developed
                forms of movement. A rotating element and motor is certainly an uncommon and
                surprising characteristic in nature that human swimmers like Arnold can only observe
                and envy. Nevertheless, it makes sense, since these traits were the response to a
                completely different set of rules on the microscopic level. </conclusion>
