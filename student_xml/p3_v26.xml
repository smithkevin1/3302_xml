            <technical_principle n="1">
                The core principle involved here is the theory of gravitation. We will be using the
                Newtonian theory, first formulated by Isaac Newton in the 17th century.
                <important_idea n="1">The gravitational force is predicated on the mass of each
                    object and the distance between them.</important_idea> This version of
                gravitation has since been replaced by General Relativity, described first by Albert
                Einstein, but still serves fine for large-scale approximations, which we will do
                here.

                Imagine it's any other day, like a Tuesday, you're going about
                your day when suddenly Pluto suddenly becomes a G-type main sequence star. This star
                is exactly identical to the Sun.

            <important_idea n="3">
                In order to make this problem more tractable, we make a few assumptions about the
                situation. First, the planets are basically aligned and at their furthest
                distance. This is important as the planets, and particularly Pluto, do not have
                perfectly circular orbits. Also this helps as the gravitational effect on the
                planets is more uniform. We will also only be looking at the effects in the short
                term. The long term effects on orbits is a complex problem that would likely take a
                fair amount of simulation, so I'll ignore it, for now. 
                <pb />
                As a notation note, I'll be using Sol1 to refer to the Sun we have now and Sol2 to
                refer to the star where Pluto is now.
            </important_idea>
            <section_header>Effects on Earth</section_header>
            <technical_principle n="2">
                Gravitation, as stated above, is predicated on three variables, the mass of object
                one, the mass of object 2, and the inverse square of the distance between them. The
                distance between Earth and the Sun (Sol1) is defined as one astronomical unit (AU),
                which is about 150 kilometers (93 million miles). The distance between Pluto (Sol2)
                and Earth is 48 times that distance. 
            </technical_principle>
            <specific_topic n="1">
                We'll first tackle the effects this change would have on us, since we're so self
                centered. The good news, sort of, is that Earth will remain in orbit mainly around
                Sol1. Since Sol2 is so very, very far away, its gravitational effect is very, very
                small compared to Sol1's (around 23 hundred times smaller). The overall effect is,
                essentially Sol1's gravity becomes slightly weaker and we move slightly further away
                from the Sol1. The net effect? Earth gets a little colder and slowly drifts
                outwards, towards an equilibrium point between Sol1 and Sol2. This may sound bad, and it is.
            </specific_topic>
            <important_idea n="4">
                Net gravitational force from Sol1 is decreased, we drift outwards, and most likely
                slowly freeze to death. This outcome is predicted even without taking into account
                other effects of having a second sun.
            </important_idea>
            <section_header>Effects on Other Planets</section_header>
            <technical_principle n="3">
                What I'll be doing here is comparing the gravitational force exerted by Sol1 with 
                the gravitational force exerted by Sol2 (on each planet). If the force exerted by
                Sol2 is the larger value, then it "captures" the planet. This is a fairly simplistic
                way of looking at this, and would only really apply in the short term.
            </technical_principle>
            <specific_topic n="2">
                Using the mass of each planet along with each planet's distance we can gain an early
                estimate of what the new solar system will look like. We'll start from the outer
                solar system and work our way in. Starting, for some reason, with Pluto (not
                actually a planet). Pluto is gone, completely, vaporized; no gravitational effect
                from either star. Neptune is captured, just barely, by Sol2 whose gravitational
                effect is around two and a half times larger than that of Sol1. It is, in fact, the
                only planet captured outright by Sol2. All the other planets, while feeling some
                gravitational effect from Sol2, are still chiefly affected by Sol1.
            </specific_topic>
            <important_idea n="5">
                Neptune is the only planet remotely close enough to Sol2 to be more affected by its
                gravity than that of Sol1. 
            </important_idea>
            <explanation>
                The effects on Earth will be similar to effects on the solar system as a whole,
                with the added downside of the fact that we live here. The general effect on the
                planets is that at first they will spread out, moving towards Sol2 as it negates
                some of the gravitational force of Sol1. In a longer time frame, the orbits of the
                planets will become more and more perturbed and complicated. In fact, at a certain
                point, some planets may be ejected from the solar system or collide with Sol1 or
                Sol2.

                <important_idea n="7">
                    The general takeaway here is that in this situation, the solar system will
                    change drastically. A side effect of this change: human extinction comes much
                    sooner than most people currently expect.  
                </important_idea>
                Luckily this situation has effectively zero percent chance of happening, so we can
                sleep easy at night knowing that Pluto will not become a star.
