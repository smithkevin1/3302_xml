        <report type="peer" resp="#g14">
            <p>In summary, this document represents the situation where Djordje is applying for a
                lead engineering position in a GE Aviation development program, wherein he outlines
                which aspects of his experience, skills, character, and interest would make him a
                competitive candidate for the open position.</p>
            <p>I'll list some typos/minor suggestions as I come across them here: In the first
                background paragraph, check for missing words, typos, etc., there are a couple that
                standout. I recommend against listing experience with Microsoft Office and then
                listing specific programs, your resume can speak to this, it's probably assumed at
                this point that everyone knows how to use these programs, only mention them if you
                are an Excel expert, etc., something that really stands out. Otherwise, I recommend
                omitting or just mentioning Microsoft Office and leaving it at that. Especially so
                since your following accomplishments are supremely more relevant and impressive.
                Consider rephrasing "traits" to "skills," or add a sentence to talk about
                personal/character trait development.</p>
            <p>In the "personal" paragraph, add in any hobbies or interests that might be relevant
                (read about aircraft development/design, etc.) or any volunteer research work you
                have done in mechanical engineering/related disciplines (or even unrelated personal
                volunteer work that speak to your character). In the final background paragraph, add
                more info on specific higher level classes that are relevant to the position, such
                as thermo, materials, etc. (you know them better than I do) - classes that
                demonstrate you have gained a comprehensive relevant education. Include any minors,
                etc. that might or might not be directly relevant (math minor, etc.).</p>
            <p>We can speak in person about exact phrasings of things, but overall the key takeaways
                are to take a more action-oriented stance, as opposed to passive suggestions, and
                minimize the use of "you" and "your" whenever possible. Remember: this is about you
                trying to get an interview, not about trying to please the reader. My ultimate
                recommendation is to use language that expresses interest in the company or the
                position -- at times you sound dispassionate and disinterested, and a hiring manager
                might not feel the urgency to call someone who outwardly uses
                passive/disinterested/last resort-type language. In terms of structure itself, I might
                suggest making your work experience last, so that your big accomplishments are the
                most recent thing on their mind when they reach the bottom. Also, upon realizing
                this is for a lead engineering position, I recommend citing any
                leadership/teamwork/teambuiling experience you have (mention it to have it come up
                in the interview) that would make you a strong candidate for this
                position, as opposed to a process engineering/lower-profile position in the same
                department with less leadership expectations.</p>
            <p>Overall, you did a great job of using all/most of the elements of the schema, and did
            a fantastic job using skills, accomplishments, programs tags. If possible, include a few
            more accomplishments to really demonstrate your prowess. After you visit each of the
            comments listed above, feel free to remove them, the XML schema agreement was impeccable
            before it started getting upset that I used my xml id multiple times (giving the red
            flags -- just delete them when you're done with them). Overall the schema use is
            perfect, only steps need to be taken on typos and rephrasings, and adding more content
            as suggested previously. Great start.</p>
