            <experience type="personal">Growing up I was exceedingly interested in the study of
                architecture. However it was not until late in highschool that I realized that my
                interests were more technical in nature. Now in my fourth year at Northeastern
                University I am pursuing a master's degree in civil engineering with a focus in
                structural. I have taken courses <note type="peer">in </note>both the technical aspects of engineering and
                design as well as a class on the history of architecture in America. <note type="peer">Formatting: extra closing accomplishments section</note><programs/>

            <p> Your background sections shows how you came to the conclusion that SOM would be a good fit for you.
            Maybe touch on how your desires play well into what SOM wants. For example, your interest in architecture
            combined with your technical expertise will allow you to be a crucial player in late-term project meetings
            where these two, commonly incompatible, goups have to meet (architects and structural engineers). Your ability in one field and your interest in the other
            sets you up well for upper management down the line as well as allows you to save the company money by not persuing one
            path initially with complete ignorance of the priorities of the other departments.
            
            For a company, having someone that can act as a technical specialist and a communications asset is extremely valuable.  </p>
