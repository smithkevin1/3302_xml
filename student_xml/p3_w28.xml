        <greeting>Dear Mr. Sarkisian,</greeting>
        <intro_para>
            <intent type="purpose">I am interested in applying for a summer internship position at
                Skidmore, Owings and Merrill.</intent>
            <intent type="connection"><!-- Optional --> After speaking with you over the phone this
                past summer</intent>, I became increasingly interested in pursuing a job with your
            company. <reason><!-- Optional --> I have a strong interest in both architecture and
                structural engineering</reason> and <proposition>I think I would be a great fit with
                the SOM culture and bring the necessary abilities to go above and beyond my job
                requirements.</proposition>

            <experience type="personal">Growing up I was exceedingly interested in the study of
                architecture. However it was not until late in highschool that I realized that my
                interests were more technical in nature. Now in my fourth year at Northeastern
                University I am pursuing a master's degree in civil engineering with a focus in
                structural. I have taken courses both the technical aspects of engineering and
                design as well as a class on the history of architecture in America. <programs/>
                <accomplishments/></experience>
            <experience type="school">I gained <skills>technical communication</skills> skills from
                my work as a TA at Knowledge University. I often had to explain technical info in
                many different ways.</experience>
            <experience type="work">I have previous experience with <programs>AutoCAD, Revit, and
                    other design programs</programs> from my previous work at Simpson, Gumpertz and
                Heger. I became well versed in <programs>AudoCAD</programs> while
                    <accomplishments>creating and updating structural and building technology
                    related drawings</accomplishments> and <accomplishments/> with it.</experience>
        </para_background>
        <closing_statements>
            <compatability>I think I will fit in well with the holistic design culture of
                SOM.</compatability>
            <pb/>
            <next_step>I have attached my resume to this letter and I hope to hear from you in the
                future regarding possible opennings for interns in the Summer of 2017.</next_step>
